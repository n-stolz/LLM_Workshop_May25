|Mitigation measures proposed|Clearing is limited to the area required for the reforestation project to reduce the exposure of bare soil to agents of erosion and deposits of debris in water systems that affect aquatic life. Clearing is by slashing and the cleared material (thrash) are left on the surface to decompose and used as mulch or ploughed and mixed into the soil to act as a soil nutrient, so as not to leave the soil completely bare. The use of heavy machinery for clearing is limited as much as possible. Miro Forestry establishes and maintains a vegetative buffer zone of 15 m each side (30 m in total) from the water bodies to reduce the risk of pollution of the water systems. Culverts and drains are being constructed along access roads to check erosion and control any runoff. Seasonal streams are being identified during the road planning stage. Access roads are compacted to minimise erosion.|

Work involving forest machinery is intermittent and restricted to the day time to minimise noise nuisance, particularly in a settlement located just on the boundary of Miro’s compartment. Reasonable speed limits and a limit on the frequency of use of forest machinery will be ensured to minimise dust emissions. The burning of large amounts of biomass or cleared vegetation will not be encouraged, as reasonably practical. Equipment will be serviced regularly to avoid excessive noise generation.|

A health and safety officer will be appointed to ensure compliance with the Policy, and the provision and use of PPE.

Sanctions will be implemented where workers do not use the PPE provided. Use of road worthy vehicles Miro Forestry regularly maintain and service its bulldozers, excavators and tractors to ensure they are in good condition. Well-maintained equipment reduce breakdowns, noise nuisance and smoke emissions, which could affect the operators’ and other workers’ health and safety. Use of qualified personnel Miro Forestry employ only qualified machine operators with requisite skills and experience to operate the machines. Miro Forestry carry out regular training on standard operating procedures, and health and safety, is provided for machine operators. First aid Miro Forestry provide first aid training for its workers and provide first aid kits at the project site during land preparation and construction activities to treat minor ailments.

The burning of large biomass or cleared vegetation will be avoided, as reasonably practical. In the event burring is required, controlled burning according to well-designed protocols will be employed. Miro Forestry will ensure workers are properly trained in slash burning protocols and observe favourable weather conditions for burning and ensure proper disposal.

|Receptors|Soil, terrestrial, flora and fauna, surface and groundwaters, aquatic species|
|Impact magnitude|Moderate|

|Mitigation measures proposed|Mechanical weed control, to the extent possible, is adopted to minimise the use of weedicides, under the FSC Pesticides Policy (2005). Miro Forestry ensure that only EPA-approved agrochemicals, from licensed agrochemical shops, will be purchased and used. All agrochemicals on the FSC list of ‘highly hazardous’ pesticides will be avoided. Miro Forestry control the application of weedicides and fertilisers by adhering to limits and recommended dosages to avoid overspills and over concentrations. Miro Forestry use selective pesticides with a low environmental impact quotient rather than broad-spectrum products to minimise impacts on non- target species The application of agrochemicals follows an integrated pest management approach. Ensure workers and farmers for the intercropping scheme are properly trained in the use and disposal methods for chemicals. Avoid using weedicides in areas close to water bodies and avoiding using them on steep slopes near water bodies. Limit the application of fertiliser to farmland that may subsequently leach/seep into underground water.|

|Mitigation measures proposed|Soil preparation on steep slopes close to water bodies will be avoided. Miro Forestry will create vegetative buffers alongside water bodies to protect them from soil sedimentation. Regular visual inspections of water bodies will be conducted to ascertain any sedimentation of water bodies. Riparian vegetation will be maintained to sieve off sediment from plantation runoff. Planting will occur between contour bunds. Ploughing without harrowing will be encouraged. The planting of seedlings will be done on ridges across the slope. Planting will be done in contour strips.|

The adoption of the Policy at the site serve as a precautionary measure to prevent/minimise the possibility of accidents and reduce health risks. Miro Forestry ensure that machinery and equipment is effective for the tasks and is in good condition to prevent accidents and injury. Workers and farmers are given adequate training on health and safety, as well as on the job training, and ensure adherence to health and safety procedures to minimise accidents. Workers are also provided with the necessary PPE and its use is enforced. The project provides, train and equip selected members of the workforce on first aid administration.

|Continuation of pre-project land use|Economic barriers: In recent times, the adoption of modern agricultural technologies and cultural practices such as irrigation, fertiliser application, the use of resistant varieties, good planting and harvesting times, among others, are improving the quality and the production of crops. The adoption of these modern practices is hindered by financial constraints as these farmers are smallholder farmers with limited financial support. Moreover, commercial banks, private partners and insurance companies are not ready to support them to adopt and apply these technologies. Climatic barriers: The agriculture is heavily dependent on weather (particularly sufficient rain) and the country has unpredictable weather conditions which represents a risk for the crop yields. Land tenure barriers: Local communities, many of which are located within forest reserve boundaries, have their activities to satisfy their needs and these activities are not aligned with the reserve’s objectives and functions. With increasing population growth over the last two decades, the demand pressure on land has been considerable.|
