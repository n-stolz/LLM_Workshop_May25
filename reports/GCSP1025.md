# **Project Design Document**

Name of project: Ghanaian Carboneers

Carboneers United B.V. (“Carboneers”) and Beyond Karbon

Date of issue: 26.08.2024

Methodology: Global Artisan C-Sink 2.1

Project location: Upper West and Volta regions, Ghana

Project start date: 06-04-2024

Project period: The project has no end date, but it is verified on an annual
basis

Project summary:

Carboneers and Beyond Karbon work with smallholder
farmers in the Upper West and Volta region of Ghana to
produce biochar from agricultural waste using soil pit
flame curtain pyrolysis, which is then mixed with compost
or manure and applied to the same and neighboring fields.
The project, certified under the Global Artisan C-Sink
Standard, has the capacity to sequester up to 50.000 tons
of CO2 annually, with each ton sequestered generating
one carbon credit.

The project will increase carbon sequestration by
working the produced biochar into different matrixes and
in this way create a long-term carbon storage with a
persistence of up to 1000 years as according to the Global
Artisan C-Sink Standard. Without the project, no C-sink
would be created since corn stalks, sorghum stalks,
peanut stalks, millet stalks, cacao pod husks and corn
cobs do not constitute a long-term carbon reservoir and is
traditionally burned in the field in the baseline scenario (or
left to rot in the case of cacao pod husks, creating
phytosanitary issues and methane emissions).

In the initial 5 years of the project we expect long term
durable carbon sequestration of up to 208.000 tons of
CO2eq in total or 41.000 tons CO2eq / year.

# **1. Purpose and general description of project**

The project Ghanaian Carboneers comprises 128 Artisan Pro Biochar Producers for biochar
production from corn stover (corn stalks, leaves and cobs left after harvest), sorghum
stalks, peanut stalks, millet stalks, and cacao pod husks *.* Biochar is a hyper versatile
material with an increasing number of applications in agriculture, environmental
engineering, and basic industry. Biochar applied to a matrix permitted by the Global Artisan
C-Sink Standard poses a stable carbon sink (C-sink). Without the project, no C-sink would
be created since corn stover, sorghum stalks, peanut stalks, millet stalks, and cacao pod
husks do not constitute a long-term carbon reservoir.

Carboneers' project demonstrates strong additionality by replacing open-field biomass decay
or burning with biochar production in areas previously lacking carbon removal practices.
This shift not only sequesters carbon but also significantly reduces methane emissions. The
project's dual impact of direct carbon removal and emission prevention clearly illustrates its
additionality, delivering substantial climate benefits where none existed before.

Another objective of the project is to improve the soil quality in the Volta and Upper West
regions of Ghana by marketing biochar as soil amendment. Biochar can improve soil quality
significantly because of its impact on the soil pH, its water retention capacity, and its ability
to store nutrients.

The biochar is then used as an effective C sink, with farmers mixing it 50/50 by volume with
cow manure or compost before applying it to their fields, ensuring long-term carbon
sequestration in the soil and added soil fertility co benefits.

The monitoring and tracking of this project will be carried out by Carboneers and Beyond
Karbon. The project has an internal monitoring mobile app (Biochar+ from Plant Village
created by The Pennsylvania State University, USA) that is used by the ground monitoring
team consisting of supervisors, managers, and general managers to monitor, report and
verify biochar production and carbon sequestration.

**1.1.** **Project location**

*Volta and Upper West regions of Ghana*
The project employs a centralized but distributed approach, utilizing soil pit flame curtain
pyrolysis directly in the villages and on farms where agricultural biomass is produced. This
method allows farmers to convert their own biomass into biochar on-site, eliminating
transportation needs and ensuring efficient resource use as well as local carbon cycles.

The geographical locations of the subsequently installed Biochar Artisan Producers will be
documented in the dMRV tool. The geographical locations of the Biochar Artisan Producers
are documented in the project’s dMRV system, the Biochar+ app from Plant Village at Penn
State.

**1.2.** **Stakeholders and partners involved**

To execute a biochar project in the Global South, Carboneers always works together
with a local implementation partner. In the case of the Ghanaian Carboneers project, the
local implementation partner is Beyond Karbon. A company that has been working with
farmers in Ghana and has experience in cookstove projects on the African continent.
Alongside each other, Carboneers and Beyond Karbon work with a Canadian NGO, Meda,
which has been working with local farming communities in Ghana for over a decade.
Carboneers is the C-Sink Manager of the project, a certification that is provided by Carbon
Standards International. This means that Carboneers has the final responsibility for
sustainable, effective and high quality biochar and carbon credits production. A visual
overview of the project structure is presented below.

**Carboneers**

Carboneers is responsible for:

- Registration of the project

- Contact with all stakeholders

- Writing the project, management plan; training plan

- On ground training of supervisors

- Checking data input from mobile application

- C-Sink registry

26.03.2024 12:57:37 36_418EN Project Design Document 5/50


-----

- Sales of carbon credit

- Payment of women groups

- Payment of supervisors

- Project supervision

**Beyond Karbon**

Beyond Karbon is the local implementation partner of the Ghanaian Carboneers project.
Beyond Karbon, in

that role, is responsible for:

- Providing farmer and women groups

- Providing educated supervisors

- Providing a project manager that carries out internal control surveys

- First respondents in case of any issue

- Payment of the management team

**MEDA**

MEDA is a Canadian NGO that has been working with local farming communities in Ghana
for over a decade. MEDA plays a crucial role in the project by providing women groups and
a field manager, as well as being responsible for checking biomass availability.

The project emphasizes gender equality and youth empowerment, with at least 50% of
beneficiaries being women and 50% being youth. In the northern part of Ghana, MEDA's
focus on women's empowerment in agriculture aligns well with the project's goals.

MEDA's office serves as a central location where Carboneers trains all supervisors provided
by Eroceht, along with MEDA's field manager and officers.

In the Upper West region, MEDA organizes women's groups consisting of community
representatives who collectively own a financial account for biochar production payments.

These groups democratically decide how to spend their earnings, with many considering
investing in groundnut shelling machines, which MEDA would partially fund in collaboration
with Carboneers.

**1.3.** **Description of baseline scenario**

In the baseline scenario, farmers primarily used to burn the waste biomass in the open field
or leave the biomass to decay. This caused significant release of CO2 and other greenhouse

gases.

Additionality is a core principle of the project. Prior to our intervention, there were no
carbon removal practices in the area. Instead, open-field burning was prevalent, resulting in
significant methane emissions.

Upon joining our project, farmers sign a declaration of honour committing to cease
open-field burning (Annex 7.3). Non-compliance results in project exclusion and loss of
associated financial benefits. However, farmers retain the freedom to continue biochar
production independently.

We have carefully assessed and mitigated potential indirect leakage. The biomass stream
utilised was not previously employed for essential purposes such as cooking, thereby
avoiding the risk of increased deforestation.

Open field burning comes with high emissions, of which methane is an important emission
(See section 3.6 of this document and annex 7.2). In our farmer training we emphasise that
optimal pyrolysis conditions depend on dry biomass, which farmers have dried out as much
as possible with a maximum allowable moisture content of 15%. This should theoretically
result in negligible methane emissions due to the gas's high flammability during the
pyrolysis process.

While quantifying emissions from biomass decay is more challenging, it is well-established
that uncontrolled decomposition leads to significant greenhouse gas emissions.

The baseline scenario for carbon removal accounting is the "business as usual", in which no
permanent biochar-based carbon sink is generated and is considered as zero. The fact that

26.03.2024 12:57:37 36_418EN Project Design Document 7/50


-----

biomass could have been used differently in the baseline scenario, has no impact on the
consideration of the baseline as zero.

𝐶−𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑘 (𝐵𝑎𝑠𝑒𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑒) = 0 𝑡𝐶𝑂2𝑒

**1.4.** **Biochar carbon sinks**

When plant biomass is burnt or decomposed, the assimilated carbon is released again in the
form of CO2. However, if the plant biomass is pyrolyzed, about half of the plant carbon is
transformed into a mixture of predominantly very persistent carbon compounds that form a
solid material known as biochar. While in the environment, any carbon compound is subject
to degradation; for most components of biochar, this process is extremely slow, and mostly
even so slow, that it is hard to measure for thousands of years. Provided that the biochar is
not burned, the biochar carbon remains as a C-sink in the terrestrial system.

If biochar with an H to Corg ratio < 0.40 is applied to soil, a major part of its carbon is
considered Persistent Aromatic Carbon (PAC, the portion of biochar carbon bound in clusters
of more than seven aromatic rings as analyzed by the hydro pyrolysis method) and will
constitute a carbon sink for several millennia. A minor though relevant part of the
biochar-carbon is less persistent (semi persistent carbon, SPC) and likely to be microbially
degraded within decades to centuries, presenting a mean residence time of 50 years. The
biochar carbon that may be decomposed within the first 1000 years after the application to
soil is called Semi-Persistent Carbon (SPC) and constitutes a temporary C-sink. For biochars
presenting an H to Corg ratio < 0.4, the PAC fraction is conservatively fixed by the standard
at 75% and the SPC fraction at 25%.

**1.5.** **Project Boundary**

All emissions occurring due to biomass sourcing, biochar production and application must be
accounted and need to be adequately offset by registered carbon sinks.

Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions as well as transport emissions from Scope 3 in connection
with the production, processing and application of biochar for the creation of a C-sink.

**1.6.** **Eligibility**

- Production of biochar according to Global Artisan C-Sink conditions.

- Farmers and Artisan Biochar Producer are not certified under any other methodology for
nature-based climate service (i.e. biomass production and soil organic carbon).

- Social Impact: Involved parties have to be compensated fairly and transparent.

- Project location: Project is located in low- or middle-income country according to the
World Bank classification.

- Biochar production does not exceed 100m3/year for a single C-Sink Farmer or
1500m3/year for a single Artisan Pro and is done with a low-tech production unit.

**1.7.** **Additionality**

Artisanal Biochar Producers do not generate income yet with biochar in most regions, there
is no market for biochar-based fertilisers, and the production costs are higher than the
expected agronomic benefit, or tropical smallholder farmers do not have the financial

26.03.2024 12:57:37 36_418EN Project Design Document 8/50


-----

resources to pay biochar-based fertilisers. Farmers could produce their biochar from their
feedstock to improve their yields, but without the training provided by the Global Artisan
C-Sink Manager, they would hardly acquire the craft to do so. The Community Service
Activity is a central aspect of the project.

The Global Artisan C-sink will, thus, be the decisive monetary incentive and knowledge
transfer to produce climate positive biochar and thus carbon sinks. The Global Artisan
C-Sink Manager will provide not only training on biochar production but also on the
preparation and application of biochar-based fertilisers, which (a) will enable most farmers
to establish this practice and (b) will avoid the adoption of unsustainable biochar production
practices which could result in pollution and GHG-emissions. Moreover, methane
compensation, as introduced by the Global Artisan C-sink is a key element to achieving net
negative emissions with flame curtain pyrolysis based biochar C-sinks.

Global Artisan C-sink assures the adoption of low-emission technology, methane
compensation, and the use of sustainably sourced biomass. Without those boundary
conditions, biochar production in countries with low purchasing power and limited financial
and technical possibilities would hardly result in net negative emissions. Hence, additionality
of any C-sink certificates issued under this standard is guaranteed.

Not all feedstock types are allowed within the Global Artisan C-Sink Standard. The
restriction of eligible biomass for biochar production is explained by the intention to avoid by
all means the overexploitation of ecosystems and the impairment of food security for the
sake of C-sink maximation.

# **3. Technology and business cases**

**3.1.** **Artisan Biochar Producer**

The C-Sink Farmer is an Artisan Biochar Producer who produces up to 100 m3 of biochar
per year from residues of her/his farm and applies this biochar back to his/her soil.
Exceptionally, biomass from neighbouring farms or debris can be used, and biochar can
be sold to other farmers when correctly tracked. C-Sink Farmers are grouped in Artisan
Networks with a maximum of 1000 participating farmers managed by an Artisan C-Sink
Manager.

Carboneers is the C-Sink Manager of the project, a certification that is provided by Carbon
Standards International. This means that Carboneers has the final responsibility for
sustainable, effective and high quality biochar and carbon credits production.

In total there are 128 groups of which 99 are coming from the Upper West region and 29
are coming from the Volta region. All these groups are registered as biochar production
locations.

Carboneers and Beyond Karbon will use the C-Sink Farmer framework in which an artisan
biochar producer produces up to 100m3 of biochar per year from residues of her/his farm
and applies this biochar back to his/her soil. Exceptionally, biomass from neighbouring
farms or debris can be used, and biochar can be sold to other farmers when correctly
tracked. C-Sink Farmers are grouped in Artisan Networks with a maximum of 1000
participating farmers managed by an Artisan C-Sink Manager.

The contract between the Global Artisan C-Sink Manager and Artisan Biochar Producers was
presented to the Certifier.

3.1.1. Training of Artisan Biochar Producer

The Global Artisan C-Sink Manager proves how the Artisan Biochar Producers were qualified
to produce high-quality biochar with low emissions. The Artisan Biochar Producer follows a
biochar production training given by a qualified trainer and proves their proficiency in an
exam. The training includes principles of feedstock selection and biomass drying, the
biochar kiln operation principles, the volume measurement of the produced biochar, a
biochar sampling procedure, and the proficient use of the Artisan smartphone app.

**Participant Selection Process**

The team structure consists of three tiers: General Managers at the top overseeing regional
operations, Supervisors managing district or village-level activities, and Farmers producing
biochar at the base. The on ground operation team is selected by both MEDA and Beyond
Karbon. All team members undergo comprehensive orientation on operational procedures.

Farmer selection leverages the operations team's expertise, targeting experienced and
motivated individuals who can serve as mentors for future participants. The enrollment

26.03.2024 12:57:37 36_418EN Project Design Document 10/50


-----

process is guided by MEDA, Carboneers and Beyond Karbon. This includes a thorough
training, project briefing and data collection, with farmers and supervisors signing a

contract.

**Training Program**

The training program encompasses all team members, from General Managers to Farmers.
It employs a multi-faceted approach combining classroom sessions and field training. The
curriculum focuses on four key areas: biomass preparation, fire management, quality
control, and supervision.

In biomass preparation, participants learn proper storage and drying techniques, with a
target moisture content below 15%. Fire management training covers controlled pyrolysis
techniques and flame curtain maintenance. Quality control education helps team members
assess biochar quality and understand factors affecting carbon sink efficiency. Supervision
training emphasises constant oversight during production and strict adherence to guidelines.

The program's effectiveness is evaluated through regular knowledge and performance tests,
with feedback collected to drive continuous improvement. The underlying philosophy is to
empower participants with practical skills that maximise the impact on climate change
mitigation.

**Monitoring System**

Supervisors play a crucial role as internal auditors. They schedule production appointments
with farmers, oversee biochar production and application, and handle data entry via the
Plant Village mobile app. This approach ensures accurate documentation and prevents
conflicts of interest.

General Managers have broader responsibilities, including overall program management,
team leadership, and communication. With approval of Carboneers and Beyond Karbon,
they have the authority to add or remove team members and farmers, and are responsible
for ensuring compliance with Global Artisan C-Sink Guidelines. Their duties also include
supervising and supporting supervisors, overseeing operations, resolving issues, and
reviewing and approving data submissions.

Data integrity is paramount in this system. Once data is submitted, it cannot be edited. If a
batch is incorrect, it can only be deleted, not modified. The review process conducted by
General Managers ensures adherence to guidelines and allows for analysis of supervisor
performance, contributing to the overall quality and effectiveness of the biochar production

program.

**3.2.** **Feedstock**

In the project the following feedstocks are corn stover (stalks, cobs and other harvest
residues), sorghum stalks, millet stalks, and cacao pod husks are used.

Biomass waste streams that will be used for the production of biochar in the North Western
region will initially be corn stover, sorghum stalks and millet stalks. In the Volta region,
26.03.2024 12:57:37 36_418EN Project Design Document 11/50


-----

biochar will be produced with cacao pod husk. All biomass that is being used, is not
considered valuable at the point of writing. It is left out for decay or uncontrollably burned
to get rid of it. With the entrance of the project, artisans will sign a declaration of honour
that declares open field burning will not be performed any longer (Annex 7.3). Appointed
internal supervisors visit artisanal farmers regularly to inspect that only sustainably biomass
sources are used to create biochar. All biomass is collected by the groups and is processed
by the leader of that group, who will be trained to sustainably and correctly convert biomass
to biochar with flame curtain pyrolysis.

All biomass does not travel a greater distance than 10 kilometres to the biochar production
location. By limiting farmers and villages to produce a maximum of 15 tons of biochar per
year it is ensured that only sustainably sourced biomass is used. To increase total project
production, the number of farmers is increased, not the production per group. This is a
more social and more environmental approach in the eyes of Carboneers. We are planning
to establish hulling stations for the smallholder farmers so they don't need to do the hulling
by hand. In that case, we will reassess the project and biomass amount per hulling station.
Origin of feedstocks; all feedstocks are derived from their own village and agricultural fields.

**Control of Methane emission during storage:**

To avoid methane emissions during biomass storage, the following principles must be
followed:

1. Use only dry feedstock:

     - Do not use freshly cut biomass or material from rain-exposed piles.

     - Store feedstock in well-ventilated, rain-protected areas.
2. Proper stacking of wet feedstock:

     - If the feedstock is wet, do not pile it higher than one meter.

     - Move the feedstock around every day.

     - This prevents self-heating, oxygen depletion, and anaerobic decomposition
that produces significant methane.
3. Handling rain-exposed feedstock:

     - If feedstock gets wet from rain, spread it in thin layers for at least three days
of sun drying.

     - Ensure the feedstock doesn't feel damp to the touch before use.
4. Enhanced moisture control measures:

     - Supervisors will use digital hygrometers to accurately check biomass
humidity.

     - The target moisture content is below 15% with a maximum admissible
moisture reading set at 15%.

     - Take an average of five measurements per cubic meter of feedstock using
handheld moisture meters.
5. Benefits of new protocols:

     - Improved quality control and production efficiency.

     - Further reduction in methane emission risks during biochar production.

These rigorous moisture control measures and protocols ensure compliance with established
guidelines and minimize the risk of methane emissions throughout the storage and
production processes.

-----

**3.3.** **Production unit**

Biochar is produced via pyrolysis technology. Pyrolysis means the thermo-chemical
decomposition of the feedstock under the exclusion of oxygen.

By converting sustainable biomass into biochar by pyrolysis, a long-term carbon reservoir is
created. The produced biochar poses a potential of C-sink (C-sink potential). It could still be
burned. By safety measures, such as marketing and labelling the biochar with the aim of
becoming an C-sink we enter into agreements with farmers, committing them not to burn
the biochar. Additionally, we provide comprehensive training on proper biochar application
techniques, including correct charging and incorporation into their fields, and monitoring all
distribution channels in a digital Measurement, Reporting and Verification tool (dMRV), it is
ensured in the best possible way, that the biochar is used to form a C-sink. C-sink
certificates are only issued for those parts of the biochar for which it can be proven that
they have been put in a matrix. Without the project, no C-sink would be created, as
non-pyrolytic biomass does not ensure persistent carbon storage.

The produced biochar is certified under the Global Artisan C-Sink standard, what guarantees
that the biomass feedstock is sustainably procured and produced, biochar fulfils the
analytical threshold values, so no damage is caused to the environment, emissions limits of
the pyrolysis unit are adhered to, and storage procedures are environmentally sound.

The biochar production follows the Global Artisan C-Sink standard, which ensures:

  - Only trained Artisan Biochar Producer are allowed to produce biochar

  - Minimization of risks on human health, social and environmental impacts

  - No forest wood and slash of forest trees are permitted as feedstock

**Flame Curtain Pyrolysis (the Kon-Tiki method)**

Our biochar production method uses soil pit flame curtain pyrolysis, an efficient and
low-cost technique based on the Kon-Tiki method. This process involves creating biochar
layer by layer in a pit dug directly into the soil.

The process begins by igniting a fire at the bottom of the pit. Once embers form a base
layer, a thin layer of biomass is added on top. This biomass quickly heats and begins to
release pyrolysis gases. These gases are captured by the flame curtain above and
combust with air entering from the top of the pit.

As each layer of biomass carbonizes, indicated by ash appearing on its surface, another
thin, evenly spread layer of fresh biomass is added on top. This new layer is heated by
both the flames above and the hot, pyrolyzing layers below, initiating its own pyrolysis

process.

The flame curtain serves two purposes: it shields the underlying biochar from oxygen
while also cleanly burning all pyrolysis gases and smoke as they pass through this hot fire
front. This layering process continues until the soil pit is filled to the desired level with
biochar.

To conclude the process, the biochar is either quenched with water or smothered with a
layer of soil to stop the pyrolysis process. This soil pit method aligns with goals of
sustainable, low-tech biochar production that can be easily implemented by local farmers
with minimal equipment requirements.

26.03.2024 12:57:37 36_418EN Project Design Document 13/50


-----

The dimensions of the soil pit are important. The angle of the sides allows the biogases to
roll upwards and burn above the fire, and the pit's depth ensures minimal wind effect on
the fire's steadiness. When the pit is too shallow, wind can disrupt the flame curtain and
allow biogases to escape. The pit's length can be extended into a trench shape for larger
batches, but the width and depth should remain consistent.

Soil pits create the same pyrolysis environment as Kon-Tiki kilns, using flame curtain
pyrolysis. The process begins with a small fire of dried stalks to generate initial heat.
Then, thin layers of biomass are systematically and evenly added manually. Gases
escaping the biomass due to heat burn over it, protecting it from external oxygen while
radiating heat that chars the biomass below. Just before ash forms on the biochar, a new
biomass layer is added to protect the earlier material from fully burning out. This new
layer provides fresh biogas to maintain a steady, hot, and stable fire.

The fire can be distributed and controlled with a rake or hoe. Artisans are trained to
stabilise and control the fire to prevent smoke generation, which indicates unwanted
methane emissions. As an additional control measure, each artisan's first batch is
recorded and shared with Carbon Standards International and Carboneers for verification
of proper pyrolysis.

A supervisor is present for each biochar batch to ensure correct production. During
Carboneers' visits to the Upper West and Volta regions, managers, field officers, and
producers are trained on smokeless biochar production. Field officers then train one
individual per farming group on biomass collection, storage, and biochar production and
application.

Soil pit selection criteria include:

  - Pits must not be near houses or vegetation.

  - Sufficient space around the pit for biomass storage and movement.

  - Excavated soil should not be piled next to the pit to prevent tripping hazards.

  - Th e p i t m ust be at l east 1 00 ce n t im et r es deep f o r fir e stab ili ty a n d win d p r otect i o n.

-----

  - Three buckets of water or sand (15 liters) must be present before production
starts for fire safety. Typically just one 15 liter bucket of water is needed so the
extra 2 buckets are there for safety reasons in cases in which the fire spreads
(which has not happened yet).

-----

A new decentralised method is also being explored, using a combination of the
established soil pit and a stainless steel chamber to enclose the system and provide more
control of flue gases and pyrolysis conditions. This aims to increase pyrolysis efficiency
and reduce methane emissions, in partnership with High Plains Biochar, an American low
and mid-tech biochar equipment manufacturer [1] . If trials prove successful, plans include
distributing this equipment to multiple farming communities to maintain a decentralised
biochar production system while increasing efficiency, biochar yield, and reducing
methane emissions.

**3.4.** **Suitability of Artisan Biochar for Agriculture**

Based on the Global Artisan C-Sink standard, Kon-Tiki biochar was extensively analysed
following the EBC and WBC analytical requirements. All biochar that was produced from
eligible feedstock with the Artisan endorsed technologies fulfilled all requirements of EBC
and WBC certification. PAHs and other potential contaminants were found with generally low
contents that allowed in all cases the certification as WBC-Agro. As PAH contents of biochar
are mainly technology dependent and generally low in Kon-Tiki and TLUD biochars, the
Global Artisan C-Sink standard does not require its regular analysis. Meeting the PAH
thresholds is covered by the pyrolysis-type accreditation of the soil pit flame curtain

-----

pyrolysis. Therefore, biochar produced under the Artisan Standard are suitable for
agricultural uses as they fulfil all requirements of WBC-Agro.

The sample plan was presented to Carbon Standards International.

**3.5.** **Application and trade of biochar**

Our biochar process is designed to be a closed-loop system within each farm, maximizing
efficiency and sustainability. Farmers are responsible for the entire process: biomass
collection, biochar production, charging, and application to their own fields.

After production, the biochar is immediately charged using manure or compost available on
the farm on a 50/50 ratio by volume. This charging process enhances the biochar's
beneficial properties. Once charged, the biochar is applied directly to the fields on the same
farm where it was produced.

Throughout this process, our supervisors closely monitor each step using the Plant Village
app to collect evidence and data. For every batch, a supervisor oversees the production
process, capturing photos of the biomass, the biochar production, the charging process with
local organic materials, and the final quantities produced. In a subsequent visit, the
supervisor documents the application of the charged biochar to the farm's soil.

All photographic evidence is geotagged and timestamped, allowing us to cross-reference the
location with the registered farmer's details. This data is then uploaded to the Plant Village
database, where it's accessible to scientists, Plant Village personnel, and other project
developers within the ecosystem.

Before the charged biochar is cleared for soil application, we thoroughly verify all collected
data and images. Once verified, the supervisor's app is updated, allowing them to oversee
and document the final step of applying the farm-specific, charged biochar to the fields.

This integrated, on-farm approach ensures that each batch of biochar is optimized for the
specific soil conditions of the farm where it's produced and used, maximizing its benefits for
soil health and crop productivity.

The following applications are possible for this project:
# ● Geological C-sink (biochar applied to soil)

**3.6.** **Methane emissions compensation**

**Offsetting methane emissions with the SPC-fraction of biochar**

The global warming effect of methane emissions caused by a Kon-Tiki or TLUD can at
least partly be offset by the global cooling effect of the first 20 years of the SPC fraction.
To calculate it correctly, the annual global cooling of the SPC for each of the first 20 years
must be summed-up and match the GWP100 of the CH 4 emission to be compensated.

The global warming effect of methane emissions caused by a Kon-Tiki or TLUD can at
least partly be offset by the global cooling effect of the first 100 years of the SPC fraction.
To calculate it correctly, the annual global warming potential effect has to be calculated for

warming potential value from the latest IPCC report) [2] and a 3.6 kg/ton of biochar
benchmark for production emissions [3] .

GWP100 for 1 ton of biochar = 0.0036 tons CH₄ × 27 CO₂eq/ton CH₄ = 0.097 tons CO₂eq
for 1 ton of biochar

However, since only the biochar carbon sink potential beyond 1000 years (75% of the
biochar fraction) is traded in the voluntary carbon credit market, we can use the 25%
fraction of the biochar that still has a carbon removal potential over the first 100 years.

For the calculation of Carbon removed by the SPC fraction of the biochar produced we use
the following example:

1. 1 ton of biochar (usually around 70-80% Carbon content) ≈0,75 tons of carbon

2. CO2 removed = Carbon content × Conversion factor CO2 removed (44/12) = 0,75 ×
3,67 = 2,75 tons

3. Therefore, 1 ton of biochar = 2,75 tons of CO2 removed.

And the SPC fraction (25%) of that would be:

4. 1 ton of biochar = 2,75 tons of CO2 removed * 0,25 = 0,68 tons of CO2eq removed

Thus, the SPC fraction of the biochar, stable for at least 100 years but most likely
anywhere from 100 to 1000 years outweighs the 100 year global warming potential from
the project over the first 100 years (0,68 tons removal > 0,097 tons emitted)

**Compensation of methane emissions by avoiding GHG-emissions from burning**
**crop residues**

In many tropical countries, crop residues are burnt directly in the fields. While it has some
positive effects on farming (ash fertilization, some pyrogenic carbon, elimination of
pests), emissions of such practices contribute to global warming and are harmful for
communities around the burn sites. Besides significant emissions of particulate matter
that cause smog (the main reason for air pollution in urban centres, methane and carbon
monoxide emissions are very high due to the uncontrolled combustion of mostly wet or

humid residues. Based on the Global Artisan C-Sink standard, it is assumed that the
overall climate impact of pyrolysis within Global Artisan C-sink is in any case not worse
than direct burning of crop residues in the field. Therefore, abandoning crop residue
burning can be accounted as an offset for emissions of Kon-Tiki pyrolysis. A declaration of
honor was submitted to Carbon Standards and approved. Including a list of which
feedstocks are eligible for this option.

**Corn Stover**

The reference for this project will be corn stover, a combination of the stalk and other
residues left behind after harvest, a very common feedstock in the Upper West region:

1. To produce one ton of biochar, 5 tons of feedstock are used (yield of 20%).

a. 1 / 0,2 = 5 tons of feedstock

2. BURNING [4] : For 5 tons of corn stover, assuming 50% of it is burned (2.5 ton):

a. **CO2** : Approximately 1756.5 kg of CO2 is released per one tonne of corn stover
burned

i. 1.7565 tons CO2 * 2.5 = 4.391 tons CO2 for 2.5 tons of biomass burned

b. **CH4** : Approximately 1.75 kg of CH4 is released per one tonne of corn stover burned

i. GWP100 = 0.00175 * 27 (kg CO2-eq/ton biochar produced) = 0.04 tons CO2eq
per 1 ton of burned corn stover.

ii. 0.04 * 2.5 = 0.1 tons CO2 eq for 2.5 tons of biomass burned

c. **Nitrous Oxide (N2O)** : Approximately 2.59 kg of N2O are released per one tonne of
burned corn stover with a global warming potential factor of 273.

i. GWP100 = 0.00259 * 273 = 0.707 tons of CO2eq per 1 ton of burned corn
stover.

ii. 0.707 * 2.5 = 1.768 tons CO2 eq for 2.5 tons of biomass burned

d. **Carbon Monoxide (CO)** : Approximately 54.495 kg of CO are released per one
tonne of burned corn stover, with a global warming potential factor of 1.9

i. GWP100 = 0.054495 * 1.9 = 0.104 tons of CO2eq per 1 ton of burned corn
stover.

ii. 0.104 * 2.5 = 0.260 tons CO2 eq for 2.5 tons of biomass burned.

e. **TOTAL GWP100 from open field burning:**

i. 4.391 + 0.1 + 1.768 + 0.260 = 6.52 tons of CO2 eq emitted for business as
usual scenario of 2.5 tons burning of corn stover.

**Excluding CO2 emissions because these are considered to be biogenic CO2, the**
**final GWP100 for the open field burning of 2.5 tons of corn stover is 2.12 tons**
**CO2 eq** (0.1 + 1.768 + 0.260)

3. Comparing with the GWP100 from producing one ton of biochar (from the same 5 tons
of corn stover feedstock) [5]

a. **CO2** : Approximately 3.6 tons of CO2 are released per ton of biochar
b. **CH4** : Approximately 3.6 kg of CH4 are released per ton of biochar

i. GWP100 = 0.0036 * 27 = 0.097 tons CO2eq
c. **N2O** : Approximately 0.012 kg of N2O are released per ton of biochar

i. GWP100 = 0.000012 * 273 = 0.0003 tons CO2eq
d. **CO** : Approximately 101 kg of CO are released per ton of biochar

i. GWP100 = 0.101 * 1.9 = 0.192 CO2eq
e. **TOTAL CO2eq GWP100 from biochar:**

i. 3.6 + 0.097 + 0.0003 + 0.192 = 3.9 tons of CO2 eq GWP100 emitted by biochar
production.

**Excluding** **biochar production CO2 emissions because these are considered**
**biogenic CO2, the final GWP100 for 1 ton of biochar from 5 tons of corn stover is**
**0.28 tons CO2 eq**

Thus, starting with 5 tonnes of corn stover feedstock, the business - as - usual scenario in
which half of the initial feedstock mass (2.5 tons) is burned in the field, the global
warming potential over 100 years is 2.159 tonnes of CO2 eq. Meanwhile, using the same
5 tonnes of feedstock for biochar production yields a total GWP100 0.3 tonnes CO2 eq.
**The difference between these values (2.12** **-** **0.28** **=** **1.84 GWP100 CO2 eq)**
**indicates** **the** **project** **represents a significant reduction in global warming**
**potential emissions** compared to the business - as - usual scenario in which around 50%
of the biomass left after harvest is burned. The avoidance of potential emissions is seen

              by Carboneers as a co benefit of the project and not valued or used as avoidance/

reduction credits.

**Millet Stalks**

Another reference feedstock for biochar production in the Upper West is Millet Stalk,
commonly burned as well after harvest. Following a similar scenario, we find the
emissions can be broken down as such:

1. To produce one ton of biochar, 5 tons of feedstock are used.

a. 1 / 0.2 = 5 tons of feedstock

2. BURNING [6] : For 5 tons of millet stalks, assuming 50% of it is burned (2.5 ton):

a. **CO2** : Approximately 1613 kg of CO2 is released per one tonne of millet stalks burned

i. 1.613 tons CO2 * 2.5 = 4.033 tons CO2 for 2.5 tons of biomass burned

b. **CH4** : Approximately 2.7 kg of CH4 is released per one tonne of millet stalks burned

i. GWP100 = 0.101 * 1.9 = 0.192 CO2eq
e. **TOTAL CO2eq emissions from biochar:**

i. 3.6 + 0.097 + 0.0003 + 0.192 = 3.9 tons of CO2 eq emitted by biochar
production.

**Excluding CO2 emissions because these are considered biogenic CO2, the final**
**GWP100 for millet stalk 0.28 tons CO2 eq**

Thus, starting with 5 tonnes of millet stalks feedstock, the business-as-usual scenario in
which half of the initial feedstock mass is burned in the field, the global warming potential
over 100 years is 2.05 tonnes of CO2 eq while using those 5 tonnes of feedstock for

**Compensation of methane emissions by avoiding GHG-emissions from biomass**
**decomposition**

When biomass is pyrolyzed that otherwise would decompose uncontrolled, the avoided
emissions from biomass decomposition can equally be used to compensate for CH 4
emissions of the Kon-Tiki. Uncontrolled decomposition, especially in the humid tropics,
can cause significant methane emissions in the same or higher range than CH 4 emissions
during Kon-Tiki pyrolysis. A detailed description and flow chart with the current practices
was submitted to Carbon Standards and approved.

In the Volta region, The growing production of cocoa has led to a significant waste
management challenge, particularly concerning cocoa pod husks and tree trimings. If
these are evenly distributed in the fields, not close to cocoa tree roots, these can be
beneficial to the cocoa trees, adding organic matter to the soil. However, when not
properly treated and left to decompose in piles, this waste becomes a substantial source
of methane, a potent greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change [8] (methane’s
greenhouse effect is 80 times more potent over the first 20 years than carbon dioxide).

For every ton of dry beans produced, approximately 10 tons of wet cacao pod husk are
generated, often left to decompose on the ground [9] . Cocoa pod waste in Ghana has been
responsible for an average annual greenhouse gas emission of approximately 10.4 million
tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent, with projections suggesting that this figure could
potentially increase twofold, reaching around 19.5 million tonnes of carbon dioxide
equivalent by the year 2030 [10] .

This practice can also lead to the leaching of highly bioavailable heavy metals like
cadmium into the topsoil where most of the roots are located [11] . Likewise, leaving cocoa
pod husk to decompose in the field also creates ideal conditions for the proliferation of
fungi and potential pathogens [12]

**Emissions reductions of cocoa production**

Residue decomposition contributes 25% of the cocoa carbon footprint in Ghana, the
second contributor after land use change emissions [13] . By managing residues, the footprint
can be significantly reduced. Though not accurate methane emissions have been reported

for the decomposition of cocoa pod husks left in the field, some estimations can be made
based on existing literature.

**Estimations from published scientific literature**

In the baseline scenario where some cacao pod husks are left to decompose in the field,
the following greenhouse gases (GHGs) and associated emissions are considered (these
values are estimations based on soil temperature, lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose
contents and decomposition rates as no emissions have been reported in the literature as
of 2024):

**Carbon Dioxide (CO2)**

Released as microorganisms break down the organic matter in cacao pod husks.

1. Cacao pod husk composition [14] :
Cellulose: 41%

Hemicellulose: 14%
Lignin: 33%
Other contents: 12%
Total easily decomposable material: 55%

2. Theoretical maximum CO2 emissions:
1 ton cacao pod husks = 410 kg cellulose + hemicellulose
If fully decomposed: ~600 kg CO2

3. Actual decomposition rate:
67% decomposition in 12 months [15]

Assuming a 67% decomposition in the first year, that equals **402 kg CO2 per ton of**
**cacao pod husks (even though this would be considered biogenic CO2).**

Adjusting for real-world conditions, considering incomplete decomposition and soil
incorporation of labile Carbon, we estimate emissions of 350-450 kg CO2 per ton in the
first year of cacao pod husks left in the field to decompose.

**Methane (CH4)**

Once again, considering reported values of cacao pod husk composition: Cellulose: 41%
Hemicellulose: 14% Total easily decomposable material: 55%

*Methane production potential* : Methane is produced under anaerobic conditions. Assuming
1-5% of decomposed carbon becomes methane (conservative estimate based on typical
soil conditions)

*Carbon content estimation* : Assuming ~45% carbon in cellulose and hemicellulose 1 ton
cacao pod husks = 410 kg cellulose + hemicellulose

Carbon available = 410 kg × 45% = 184.5 kg

*First-year decomposition* : 67% decomposition in first year (from previous estimate)
Carbon decomposed = 184.5 kg × 67% = 123.6 kg

Methane production estimate: 1-5% of decomposed carbon becomes methane

Methane carbon = 123.6 kg × (1% to 5%) = 1.24 to 6.18 kg

Converting carbon to methane mass: Molecular weight ratio of CH4 to C is 16:12

**Methane produced = (1.24 to 6.18 kg) × (16/12) = 1.65 to 8.24 kg CH4 per ton**
**of cacao pod husks**

The 100 years GWP of these emissions would be

***GWP100 = [0.0012 to 0.0062] * 27 (kg CO2-eq/ton biochar produced) =***
***0.032 to 0.167 tons CO2eq for one ton of cacao pod husks left to decompose.***

**Nitrous** **Oxide** **(N2O):** Released during the decomposition of nitrogen-containing
compounds in the cacao pod husks Has a high global warming potential

By converting cacao pod husks to biochar instead of allowing them to decompose, the
project activity would potentially reduce these baseline GHG emissions. Biochar
production would stabilize a significant portion of the carbon in the cacao pod husks,
preventing its release as CO2 during decomposition. Additionally, it would likely reduce
CH4 and N2O emissions that occur during natural decomposition processes.

Furthermore, the application of biochar to soil will have an additional GHG mitigation
effect. Biochar in the soil can prevent the leaching of plant available nutrients and release
of GHGs (including inorganic-N leaching, N2O emissions, and ammonia volatilization) from
the decomposition of organic material already present in the soil at the moment of
application [16] .

Thus, biochar application not only removes carbon from the cacao pod husks but also
helps to stabilize existing soil organic matter, providing a dual benefit in terms of GHG
emission reduction.

**3.7.** **digital Monitoring, Reporting and Verification (dMRV)**

Technically, the C-Sink Artisan certification procedure is based on a digital monitoring,
reporting, and verification (dMRV) tool, which is usually a dedicated smartphone application.

The production of biochar is monitored using the PlantVillage mobile application, developed
by Penn State University under the leadership of David Hughes. (For a comprehensive

explanation of how the PlantVillage app works, you can watch David's video presentation
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmYSJC2-Urk&t=475s) = lmYSJC2 - Urk&t = 475s)

We have implemented a system involving managers, supervisors, and biochar-producing
farmers. Farmers are responsible for biomass collection, biochar production, and soil
application.

Supervisors oversee every step of the process using the PlantVillage app to collect evidence
and data. For each batch, a supervisor visits the site to monitor the production process.
They photograph the biomass, the production process, the quantity of biochar produced,
and later, the application of biochar to the soil. Each photo is timestamped, dated, and
geotagged.

The GPS location is cross-checked against the farmer's registered location. In the backend,
we can see how far the photo was taken from the expected biochar production site.

Once the supervisor uploads the data to the PlantVillage database, we can check the status
of biochar production and application. This data is accessible to all members of the
PlantVillage ecosystem, including scientists, PlantVillage personnel, and other project
developers.

Before the biochar is cleared for soil application, we verify the photos and data. Once
verified, the information becomes available in the supervisors' app, allowing them to
proceed with the final application step.

**3.8.** **Planned business development**

In 2024, the Carboneers Indian projects are expected to produce 45000 carbon credits.
Introducing this new project in Ghana, with the key partnerships with local NGO’s we have
an ambitious goal to be able to grow to 1 million tons of durable CDR by 2026. To achieve
this goal, we would have to develop 35 more projects in the coming two and a half years as
each project is roughly limited to 25.000 tons of CDR annually. We are currently already
making preparations for 3 more projects in India, 2 more in Ghana and one in Suriname.
From start till end, with the right preparations, it takes roughly 3 months to set up an
entirely new project. When we create new projects adjacent to our current projects in India
and Ghana, this can be done within a month and with multiple projects in the same
timeframe.

In Ghana, our projects are expanding rapidly, particularly in the cocoa sector. We are
finalising partnerships with major chocolate companies this year, which will:

  - Give us access to an extensive network of farmers

  - Generate revenue to support and develop our projects

These successful collaborations are key to our growth and impact in the region.

**3.9.** **Internal Control System**

# **4. Determination of C-sink**

**4.1.** **Monitoring**

All data which is required to calculate the C-sink is entered into the dMRV System Plant
Village. The dMRV system is either provided by Carbon Standards or by an external MRV
system provider. External MRV systems and tools must be endorsed by Carbon Standards
annually. The data will be monitored as mentioned below.

Data required for C-sink calculations is entered into a dMRV (digital Measurement,
Reporting, and Verification) system provided by PlantVillage from Penn State University.

*Biochar Production Process:*

1. Locally trained supervisors oversee each batch of biochar production.

2. Supervisors are present before, during, and after production.

3. Supervisors have exclusive access to the mobile application for registering soil pits
and artisanal farmers.

*Post-Production Handling:*

1. Biochar is stored in Plant Village conformant standardized 20-liter bags that are
distributed to participating farms. We record the number of bags delivered, as well as
number of bags used vs unused.

2. Weight is determined based on the biomass source and previously analyzed bulk
density of the corresponding biochar and the volume of the standardized bags.

*Data Collection and Verification:*

1. Supervisors provide production data and photographic evidence through the mobile
application.

2. Each entry includes a time and geographic stamp.

3. Data is checked weekly by Carboneers via the application's backend.

4. Carboneers verifies that uploaded photos align with the volumes claimed by farmers
and supervisors.

*C-sink Calculation and Reporting:*

1. Carboneers calculates the C-sink using data and formulas from the Global Artisan
C-Sink guidelines.

2. After verification and calculation, biochar production and carbon sequestration
potential data are shared monthly with Carbon Standards International.

3. Carbon Standards International maintains a C-Sink registry to prevent double
counting.

4.1.3. Compensation of Fossil Emissions

All fossil CO 2 emissions must be offset by long-term carbon sinks before the registration of a
biochar C-sink can be validated in the Global C-Sink Registry.
CO 2 must only be offset with geological C-sinks, such as the persistent aromatic carbon
(PAC) fraction of soil-applied biochar, that are registered in the Global C-Sink Registry.
The emission offsets can be realised with the registered permanent biochar C-sink whose
production had caused the emission.

-----

In a recent article by Cornelissen et al 2023, authors state that methane emissions
from biochar production using biomass under 15% moisture content are much lower,
at 0-3.6 grams of methane per kilogram of biochar [18] . Further readings of the moisture
content of our feedstock will help refine the estimated methane emissions produced by
our projects.

Given the current Artisan Standard uses a 30kg CH4/ton of biochar produced
reference, we will consider that as the project emissions reference, keeping in mind
that this value is probably going to be much lower given our feedstock moisture
measurements not surpassing 15%.

Accordingly, ex-ante definition of the following parameter:

4.1.5. Compensation of CH4 Emissions

Methane compensation is defined as creating a carbon sink for 20 years that has a climate
cooling effect equal to the climate warming effect of a methane emission over 100 years
after the emission occurred. Thus, the total climate forcing of a methane emission must be
compensated within 20 years after the initial emission.

|Parameter|Monitoring frequency|Source of data|
|---|---|---|
|Proof of compensation|per C-Sink Unit|Carboneers Emission portfolio|



4.1.6. Leakage emissions

The Global C-Sink Standard prohibits non-sustainable biomass cultivation, land use change
and soil organic carbon depletion - thus, leakage in sense of carbon expenditure outside of
the project boundaries is avoided as much as possible. It is assumed that activity shifts to
biochar production causes only minimal leakage emissions.
For the Global Artisan C-Sink, the emissions from Scope 1 and 2 are fully recorded. As per
project boundary, from Scope 3, only the emissions from biochar transport are directly
quantified if the distance is more than 100 km. Other indirect emissions from Scope 3 are
not recorded individually due to their comparatively low volume but are instead included in
the calculation with a security margin.

This includes, for example, the emissions caused by:
# ● the fuel for transportation of the biomass feedstock to the kiln, ● or the transportation of the biochar to the fifield (up to 100 km),
## ● the displacement of the kiln ● a pump for quenching water ● fuel for a chain saw for pruning, milling, and blending of the biochar

To keep the certification procedures reasonably lean, Artisan Biochar Producers

are not required to provide a detailed account of these potential emissions, but a margin of
security of 20 kg CO2e per ton of biochar (DM) is levied.

4.1.7. Methane emissions

During the pyrolysis process methane emissions are produced. They are calculated
according to the following formula:

𝑝𝑦𝑟𝑜𝑙𝑦𝑠𝑖𝑠

*4.1.7.2. Compensation of CH* *4* *Emissions*
To compensate for methane emissions, the GWP100 of the emitted amount of non fossil
methane is calculated using the factor 27 kg CO2eq per kg CH 419 . We then calculate the

absolute global warming potential (AGWP) over 100 years using Jeltsch-Thömmes & Joos
(2019). The AGWP must then be compensated by a same-sized absolute global cooling
potential (AGCP) over a maximum of 20 years. The compensating global cooling must start
in the same year as the CH 4 emission occurred, provide annual global cooling in every
following year, and finalize the compensation latest 20 years after the methane emission.

[𝐶𝑂2𝑒 𝑜𝑓 𝐶𝐻4 𝑒𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠 𝑝𝑒𝑟 𝑙𝑜𝑎𝑑] = 𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑚𝑒𝑡ℎ𝑎𝑛𝑒 𝑒𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠[ ] * 𝐺𝑊𝑃100_𝐶𝐻4

With GWP100_CH4 = 27 CO 2 eq [20]

Greenhouse gases decay in the atmosphere. The quantities of CO 2 still present in the
atmosphere each year are added up over the 100 years, resulting in the absolute global
warming potential (AGWP) over 100 years.

CO 2 decay is described by:

# **5. Registration of C-sink**

Biochar carbon sinks must be registered with the geo-localized area where the biochar or its
derived products have been applied. This encompasses scenarios where biochar serves as a
soil amendment or finds application in various contexts, such as construction for residential,
infrastructural, or road-related purposes.
In certain specific instances where marginal quantities of biochar are applied or utilized in
products, the registration of so-called diffuse carbon sinks (i.e., non-geo-localized) is
permitted.

The following information are registered for biochar carbon sink:

1 Feedstock of biochar production
2 Technology of production
3 Date or period of production
4 C-content and H/C ratio of biochar (measured or taken from the Ithaka database)
5 Matrix into which the biochar was mixed (compost, manure, feed, cement etc.)
6 Location of the C-sink (vector file of field location; for fields < than 1000 m2 one GPS
point per field is sufficient, for C-Sink Networks and C-Sink Villages only the vector file
of the network and village, respectively, is needed)
7 Amount of biochar applied in tons (dry matter tons)
8 Date of application
9 Owner of the C-sink site (name, address, birth date – not necessary for C-Sink
Network and C-Sink Village)
10 C-sink project design document
11 Validation report of the validation body
12 Verification report of the verification body
13 Monitoring plan of the operation
14 Confirmation of the compensation of the emission portfolio of the biochar

**4.2.** **Calculation of C -sink**

The C-sink is registered in the Global C-sink Registry.

Based on the Global Artisan C-Sink standard, the calculation of the C-sink at day of
application is:

[𝐶𝑦𝑒𝑎𝑟= 0( )] = 𝑑𝑟𝑦 𝑚𝑎𝑠𝑠 𝑜𝑓 𝑏𝑖𝑜𝑐ℎ𝑎𝑟 𝑎𝑝𝑝𝑙𝑖𝑒𝑑[ ] * 𝐶 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑡[ ] * [44] 12 [ −𝑠𝑒𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑦 𝑚𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑖𝑛] [ ]

However, every biochar C-sink underlies a time-dependent evolution, and the C-sink is a
measure of the mass of carbon that is physically present in the C-sink matrix at any given
moment in time since the establishment of the C-sink. The size of a biochar C-sink is, thus,
a function of the type of biochar determining its specific persistence in a specific C-sink
matrix and the time since the application to the C-sink matrix.

𝐶−𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑘𝑦𝑒𝑎𝑟( ) = 𝐶−𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑘(𝑦𝑒𝑎𝑟= 0) * 𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑓𝑖𝑐 𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑠𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑒 (𝑦𝑒𝑎𝑟)

4.2.1. Geological C-sink

According to the Global Artisan C-Sink standard, Biochar made in a soil pit flame curtain
pyrolysis Kon-Tiki reach highest treatment temperatures above 650°C and present an
H/Corg ratio well below 0.4, indicating a PAC fraction of at least 75% when applied to soil.

26.03.2024 12:57:37 36_418EN Project Design Document 34/50


-----

Certified artisan biochar is, therefore, registered with a PAC-fraction of 75% and SPC
fraction of 25% in the Global C-Sink Registry.

The remaining carbon for soil-applied biochar is calculated with the following conservative
approximation:
# [𝑟𝑒𝑚𝑎𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝐶 (𝑦𝑒𝑎𝑟)]=[𝑑𝑟𝑦 𝑚𝑎𝑠𝑠 𝑜𝑓 𝑏𝑖𝑜𝑐ℎ𝑎𝑟 𝑎𝑝𝑝𝑙𝑖𝑒𝑑 ]/1000 * Ccontent * ( 750 + 45 * e [-0.5232 * year] + 205 * e [-0.009966 * year] )

When C-sinks are sold to offset CO2 emissions only the PAC fraction must be used.
The SPC-fraction of biochar can be used for methane emission offsets.

No other matrixes other than soil are used

**7.3 Biochar application guidelines**

Biochar application guidelines

Biochar closely resembles charcoal in appearance and combustion properties, and is
commonly used for cooking in many countries. This similarity poses a challenge: ensuring
biochar is utilized as a carbon sink rather than as fuel. Our project implements several
methods to guarantee proper usage, each requiring photographic evidence uploaded via a
mobile application.

Preferred methods of application:

1. Mixing with manure (primary recommendation):

`o` Reduces burning potential

`o` Creates an effective carbon sink

`o` Immediately enriches biochar with nutrients

2. Co-composting:

`o` Decreases combustion risk

`o` Enhances nutrient content

3. Direct soil application:

26.03.2024 12:57:37 36_418EN Project Design Document 43/50


-----

`o` Note: Initially, untreated biochar may temporarily absorb soil nutrients before
releasing them later

We currently favor the manure-mixing method due to its simplicity and the region's
abundant manure supply. However, we also accept direct field application and
co-composting.

To promote adoption, we educate farming communities on biochar's benefits, including
improved soil water retention and nutrient availability. This approach not only enhances
agricultural productivity but also reduces the likelihood of biochar misuse as fuel.

**7.4 Training Protocol**

**Training manuals**

The training includes principles of feedstock selection and biomass drying, the biochar kiln
operation principles, the volume measurement of the produced biochar, a biochar sampling
procedure, and the proficient use of the Plant Village+ smartphone app.

**Participant Selection Process**

The team structure consists of three tiers: General Managers at the top overseeing regional
operations, Supervisors managing district or village-level activities, and Farmers producing
biochar at the base. The on ground operation team is selected by both MEDA and Beyond
Karbon. All team members undergo comprehensive orientation on operational procedures.

Farmer selection leverages the operations team's expertise, targeting experienced and
motivated individuals who can serve as mentors for future participants. The enrollment
process is guided by MEDA, Carboneers and Beyond Karbon. This includes a thorough
training, project briefing and data collection, with farmers and supervisors signing a
contract.

**Training Program**

The training program encompasses all team members, from General Managers to Farmers.
It employs a multi-faceted approach combining classroom sessions and field training. The
curriculum focuses on four key areas: biomass preparation, fire management, quality
control, and supervision.

In biomass preparation, participants learn proper storage and drying techniques, with a
target moisture content below 15%. Fire management training covers controlled pyrolysis
techniques and flame curtain maintenance. Quality control education helps team members
assess biochar quality and understand factors affecting carbon sink efficiency. Supervision
training emphasises constant oversight during production and strict adherence to guidelines.

The program's effectiveness is evaluated through regular knowledge and performance tests,
with feedback collected to drive continuous improvement. The underlying philosophy is to
empower participants with practical skills that maximise the impact on climate change
mitigation.

**Monitoring System**

26.03.2024 12:57:37 36_418EN Project Design Document 44/50


-----

Supervisors play a crucial role as internal auditors. They schedule production appointments
with farmers, oversee biochar production and application, and handle data entry via the
Plant Village mobile app. This approach ensures accurate documentation and prevents
conflicts of interest.

General Managers have broader responsibilities, including overall program management,
team leadership, and communication. With approval of Carboneers and Beyond Karbon,
they have the authority to add or remove team members and farmers, and are responsible
for ensuring compliance with Global Artisan C-Sink Guidelines. Their duties also include
supervising and supporting supervisors, overseeing operations, resolving issues, and
reviewing and approving data submissions.

Data integrity is paramount in this system. Once data is submitted, it cannot be edited. If a
batch is incorrect, it can only be deleted, not modified. The review process conducted by
General Managers ensures adherence to guidelines and allows for analysis of supervisor
performance, contributing to the overall quality and effectiveness of the biochar production

program.

**Internal Control of Supervisors**

To ensure supervisors are performing their tasks correctly, Carboneers checks all data
incoming through the application. This is done in collaboration with Plant Village staff, and
the information is accessible to anyone in the Plant Village ecosystem, allowing peers such
as other project developers using Plant Village+, such as Biochar Life, to verify the data's

accuracy.

In addition to online checks, on-site managers in both project areas conduct internal
inspections. The objectives are to:

1. Ensure only correct biomass is used

2. Assess the skill of biochar producers

3. Check supervisors' data entry skills

4. Verify correct application of biochar to soils

Managers are equipped with moisture and temperature meters to test biomass dryness and
monitor pyrolysis temperatures, ensuring high-quality biochar production and sustainable
carbon sinks without unwanted methane emissions.

**Conflict of Interest Avoidance**

Supervisors and biochar producers are compensated differently to avoid conflicts of interest.
As explained in the financial section, supervisors receive a monthly wage, while biochar
producers are paid per ton of biochar produced. The manager, a key staff member of
Beyond Karbon, doesn't receive additional funding for the project. It's the manager's
responsibility to produce internal inspection reports and identify potential conflicts of
interest between supervisors and producers.

**Internal Control System**

26.03.2024 12:57:37 36_418EN Project Design Document 45/50


-----

Internal inspection reports will reveal errors, especially in the early stages, which need to be
addressed. Errors are categorized as either human errors or intentional errors. The manual
will further explain how managers should respond to these errors.

The purpose of internal inspection reports is to detect errors and train individuals to
improve. However, when fraud is detected, serious measures will be taken, and the
offending women's group will be suspended from the system. The severity of the fraud will
determine the length of the suspension.

**Participating Villages**

The entire system, including managers, supervisors, internal control, and the mobile
application, applies to all farmers. The social structure is consistent across all villages,
allowing for uniform implementation of the system. Participating villages were pre-selected
based on feasibility for proper inspection by the team. Some villages are only accessible by
motorcycle or on foot, not by car.

**Internal Inspection Report**

Our internal inspection report includes all key factors relevant to our conditions, in
compliance with the Global Artisan C-Sink Standard. The mobile application forms the basis
of the inspection report. As the application was developed internally, it's easy to control data
input. If changes are needed to enhance security and transparency, they can be easily
implemented. The goal is to develop a system with minimal human intervention and
automatic data control.

In addition to data from the mobile application, managers continuously inspect various
farmers and supervisors. Results from these inspections are shared monthly with
Carboneers and Beyond Karbon. An annual inspection report detailing all system
abnormalities will be produced and made available upon request.

**Quality of Internal Inspection Reports**

A strict manual guides managers in controlling supervisors and artisanal farmers.
Standardizing checklists and internal reports ensures no aspect of the system is overlooked
during inspections or communications with Carboneers and Beyond Karbon. As a control
measure, managers' internal reports are cross-referenced with data from the mobile
application. Any abnormal data from the application should be noted by managers in the
weekly internal inspection report.

**Follow-up on Internal Inspections, Corrective Actions, and Sanctions**

**Evaluation of Internal Reports and Non-Conformities**

Data analysis generates error reports, which managers regularly monitor to initiate
corrective actions. Errors are categorized into two types:

1. System errors (e.g., internet unavailability) and understandable human errors

2. Intentional errors

Intentional errors are taken seriously, with the specific individual flagged in the weekly
internal report. After one year, the flag can be removed if managers deem the individual
trustworthy.

Monthly internal reports are reviewed separately by Beyond Karbon and Carboneers.
Subsequently, they meet to discuss the report's content and, if necessary, determine
corrective measures to be executed by Beyond Karbon.

For human errors, strict repercussions aren't necessary after a single occurrence. However,
the individual is flagged and monitored for three months. If no further incidents occur, the
flag is removed. If another flag arises, a manager assesses whether the individual is
suitable for the biochar production project. If not, the individual is removed from the

program.

For intentional errors, the individual receives a personal warning from the manager. A period
of stringent monitoring follows, and if another issue arises, the individual is removed from
the program.

To streamline internal inspections, corrective actions, and sanctions, an annual meeting is
held between managers, Beyond Karbon, and Carboneers.

**Implementation of Sanctions**

Sanctioned individuals are restricted from participation in two ways:

1. Technically: Their profile is blocked in the mobile application, preventing data input
and rewards for biochar production.

2. Physically: The responsible manager personally meets with the individual to remove
them from the program.

**Handling of Complaints**

Artisanal farmers can file complaints with their supervisor. To address potential complaints
about supervisors, regular supervisor rotation is implemented. Complaints are forwarded to
managers and incorporated into the monthly internal report. Supervisors can also file
complaints with managers, which are likewise incorporated into the monthly internal report.
All complaints are addressed and noted in person by the senior team involved in program
implementation.

**7.6 Biochar Sampling Plan**
## Objective: To ensure consistent monitoring and quality control of biochar produced from different biomass species by systematically collecting and analyzing samples. **Sampling Procedure:**

## 1. Sampling Frequency: ○ A sample of 500 milliliters of biochar will be collected every month 2. Sampling Responsibility: ○ The sampling will be conducted by all the designated supervisors overseeing the biochar production. 3. Sampling Process: ○ Selection of the Batch: Each month, the supervisor will select a production batch to take a sample from, the sample is randomly taken from the produced biochar. ○ Collection of the Sample: The supervisor will take a 500 milliliter sample of biochar from the selected batch. Care should be taken to ensure that the sample is representative of the entire batch. 4. Labelling of Samples: ○ Each sample must be labeled immediately after collection with the following information: ■ Date of Sampling: The exact date when the sample was taken. ■ Biomass Source: The specific biomass species from which the biochar was produced (e.g., rice straw, cotton stalks, corn cobs, cocoa pods). 5. Sample Storage and Documentation: ○ The collected sample should be stored in a clean, dry container that is sealed to prevent contamination, which in this case is a 500 milliliter drinking bottle. ○ The supervisor must document the sampling process, including the date, biomass source ○ The supervisor will send or deliver the sample with the manager. **6. Sample preparations:** ○ The manager will mix all the samples that are derived from the same biomass species and take another 1 liter sample of the mixed pile. This is done for all biochars. The 1 liter samples are labeled and sent to an accredited laboratory This plan ensures that biochar samples are collected consistently and systematically across different biomass sources, enabling accurate monitoring of biochar quality and adherence to project standards. **7.7 Ex Ante Calculations** Dry mass = tons of feedstock * 0.2 C content = Biochar weight * 0.7 Tons CO2 eq = C content * (44/12) Accounting for safety margin = Tons CO2 eq * 0.98
