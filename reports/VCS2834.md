##### **2 GENERAL ** **2.1 Project Goals, Design and Long-Term Viability **

**2.1.1** **Summary Description of the Project (G1.2)**

The proposed mangrove restoration grouped project intends to generate GHG emission removals by
restoring the ecosystems in a first project instance of 7,019.8, by planting around 32 million new mangrove
trees. This is a grouped project, with scoping for new planting sites within the 17 communes where
agreements have been made with local Mayors. Future project activity instances will include a 300 m buffer
zone around the initial project activity instances will be added to the project, to ensure areas of mangrove
growth due to modeled sea level rise, as well as the associated CO 2 removals, are included in the project’s
boundaries. The project area is located in Sine-Saloum Delta and Casamance Estuary in Senegal, mostly
within the boundaries of protected areas. The plantation will take place in selected locations according to
ecological conditions, together with the local communities, through a design that implies the active
participation of communities involved in the project.

The first project activity instance is planned to be planted between 2020 and 2022. An estimated 3,238.33
ha in Casamance and 3,781.46 ha in Sine-Saloum will be planted, with an estimated 32,000,000 trees.
Most of the plants will be *Rhizophora mangle* (75%), 15% will be *Rhizophora racemosa,* and 10% will be
*Avicenna germinans* . See Figures 1 to 4 for maps of the project area.

*Figure 4: Sine-Saloum Phase 1 and Buffer*

Prior to the implementation of the project, the habitat is degraded mangrove, where the mangrove
degradation factors are multiple. [17]

The annual average GHG removals through sinks is estimated ex–ante as 49,248 tCO 2 -e, with a total value
of 1,477,455 tCO 2 -e over a 30-year crediting period.

The goal of the project is to increase the mangrove area by planting a variety of species of native mangrove,
which will increase the positive functions (ecosystem services) that mangroves provide to communities and
biodiversity.

The overall project’s climate, community, and biodiversity objectives are:

*1.* to mitigate climate change through the removal of GHG within biomass growth
*2.* to improve the well-being of local communities by creating job opportunities, increasing available

natural resources, improving livelihoods, and enhancing the capacities of residents
*3.* to restore degraded wetlands and to improve environmental conditions, restoring ecological

services, and enhancing the biodiversity index.

17 The drought of the 1970s and 1980s, the construction of infrastructure (roads or hydro-agricultural), and deforestation

caused by extraction of trees for firewood and construction. Human activities such as mangrove cutting for fish smoking,
oyster picking and some fishing practices, as well as climate change, have led to mangrove degradation, reducing their

area.

***Topography***

The geology of Senegal’s formation began more than two billion years ago. From a geological point of view,

Casamance has two central units:

  - The continental basin of the Middle and Upper Casamance, formed by the sandstone plateau of
the Continental Terminal (CT). This surface is generally relatively flat, with an altitude not exceeding

50m.

  - The maritime basin includes the Lower Casamance and where there is a permanent maritime
influence due to the altitude not exceeding 30m.

The CT covers most of the Senegal basin and appeared in the Miocene (Sall et al., 2000, cited by Bassene,
2016 [19] ). Pagès et al. (1987, cited by Bassene, 2016), specifies, based on various works, that the Gulf of

Casamance, indented but shallow, has been gradually backfilled since the Ugolian (-20,000 years).
Coastlines and mudflats were set up during the accompanying wet period of the Flandrian transgression.
Mangroves have colonized these marshy areas which are crossed by many channels strongly anastomosed
and drained by the tide, the bolongs.

Quaternary deposits, on the other hand, are observed over the whole of Senegal and present distinct
hydrological conditions. In his thesis defended in 2001 on “The recent Quaternary of western Senegal (lakes
Retba and Tanma; estuary of Casamance) Eustatic and paleoclimatic implications of diatoms”, El hadji
SOW, who studied the lithology and the diatom microflora of the carrot de Ziguinchor, drew the following

conclusions:

  - Ziguinchor has always been an area under the marine influence in the recent Quaternary. The
behavior of the environment is that of a maritime gulf gradually passing to a lagoon which shows a
slight opening during the last centuries.

  - Mangrove colonization occurred after the closure of the old gulf by the shorelines.

*Figure 8: Topography of 12 communes included in the project in Casamance Region* *[20]*

In the case of Sine-Saloum, it is characterized by low relief, with an altitude of no more than one meter
everywhere, which makes its topography a relatively important asset for the development of natural
heritage, particularly rich biodiversity (marine and terrestrial flora and fauna). Indeed, the flatness, combined

with the humidity of the deltaic environment, is considered the primary physical characteristic of the local
ecological and biogeographic setting.

We can distinguish topographic units such as:

      - the slightly raised terraces

      - sandy cords

      - isolated mounds

      - areas prone to flooding by tides.

*Figure 9: Topography of 5 communes included in the project in Sine-Saloum Region. .* *[21]*

***Soils***

The soils are mainly sandy and sandy clay made up of dior soils (little leached tropical ferruginous soils),
dekk soils (finer-textured soils with a high proportion of fine sand and silt), hydromorphic with temporary
waterlogging, so-called soils dekk-dior and dior-dekk, halomorphic soils (saline soils, ‘tanne’ in Wolof), and
mangrove soils observed in islands and estuaries.

## CCB & VCS PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

*CCB Version 3, VCS Version 3*

The mangrove mudflats are characterized by three main types of soil [22] :

      - Acid sulfate soil: which has already undergone acidification by oxidation due to an annual
alternation of submersion and drying. This is the mangrove zone.

      - Potentially acid sulfate soil: subject to the influence of twice-daily tides, characterized mainly
by their high sulfide content, which remains reduced as long as the submergence is maintained,
and by a neutral pH. These soils are rich in organic matter.

      - Tannic soil: an extension of the terrace zone which is only reached by spring tides and
occupied, depending on the degree of salinity, by herbaceous plants in the edge zone or by a
soil with a powdery structure or a saline crust.

Sine-Saloum is characterized by [23] :

      - leached tropical ferruginous soils, developed respectively in the sandstone cover of the

continental terminal and in the continental dunes

      - tan-colored acid sulfate floors which serve as a resting place for birds, as well as for certain
mammals, such as the green monkey, which likes the crabs that inhabit this type of soil

      - low-evolved organic hydromorphic soils of current marshes which constitute feeding areas for
certain migratory birds such as the curlew (Numenius phaeopus) and the ash curlew

      - mineral soils and little evolved soils on recent sandy lines or accumulation of aeolian silts which
constitute the preferred resting places for steroids

      - rendzine-type calcimorphic soils rich in organic matter from artificial clusters of shells.

***Climate***

The climate in Senegal is tropical, with differences associated with the locations of the project area. While
the Saloum Delta belongs to the Sudanese climate domain, the Casamance Estuary is located in the
Sudanese-Guinean and Sub-Guinean climate domains, and it is influenced by the Sub-Guinean
intertropical climate of alternate seasons: dry season and rainy season.

The dry season typically lasts from six months in the south (November–April) to 8–10 months in the north.
Even though the period from November to April is referred to as the dry season, precipitation occurrence is
not unusual, especially from December to April. Southwest–northeast-oriented cloud bands coming from
the Atlantic Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) cause these off-season rains, which represent about
1% of the annual rainfall [24] .

The monsoon lasts between May and October in Casamance, and rainfall exceeds 1,000mm in a normal
year in the whole area. The average temperature in Casamance is 27.7˚C at the Ziguinchor station, but
there is a hidden value disparity. It varies first with the seasons: minimum temperatures are reached in
January with 14.9°C, while the maximums are recorded at the end of the dry season with 37.1°C in March,
37.4°C in April, and 35.7°C in May. The sea also acts as a thermal regulator. The maritime area benefits
from milder temperatures and does not register strong seasonal fluctuations as does the country’s interior.

Sine-Saloum is surrounded by an environment characterized by a Sudanese tropical climate which includes
the Sahelo Sudanese variant and a Sudano Sahelian variant. It is also influenced by the maritime climate
on the coastline of Foundiougne and Fatick departments. It has the particularity of having a rainy season
ranging from June–July to October and a dry season of 8–9 months. Average annual precipitation values
vary between 880mm in the south and 354mm in the north.

Concerning temperatures, minimum annual averages between 21°C and 24°C occur from December to the
end of February. Maximum annual averages between 35°C and 42°C occur between March and June.

***Hydrology***

Senegal’s hydrographic network results, on the one hand, from the geological and geomorphological
configuration of the country, and, on the other hand, from the regime and distribution of rainfall in the subregion (DGPRE) [25] . Essentially, this network is dependent on the basins of the Senegal and Gambia rivers,
the waters of which come from the Fouta Djallon massif located in the Republic of Guinea.

Besides these two large rivers, there are some small rivers, such as Casamance, Kayanga, Anambé, Sine,
Saloum, and coastal basins whose flows are intermittent. A certain number of lakes and ponds complete
this hydrographic network (Lac de Guiers, bolongs in estuaries and ponds in the Niayes region). In addition,
the country has wetlands that are most often associated with a functional or degraded hydrographic

network.

In Sine-Saloum, the water resources consist of surface water and water underground. Surface water
consists of perennial rivers Sine, Saloum and Gambia, and tributaries located in the department of
Foundiougne. There are also temporary watercourses made up of backwaters and ponds. Groundwater
consists of Maastrichtian aquifers, Paleocene, Eocene, and late continental.

In Casamance, the hydrology is characterized by the presence of a mainstream, the Casamance River.
The dynamics of its flow are dominated by two factors: the movement of regional tides and rainfall.

The Casamance River is the only river in Senegal that flows entirely within Senegal. It originates within the
Senegalese borders and covers a watershed of 20,150km².

***Types of vegetation***

The mangrove vegetation in the reference area depends on the physical and ecological conditions (such
as altitude, slope, salinity, tides and soils, among others), as well as the degree of degradation of the
ecosystems.

Mangrove areas in Senegal have suffered a major decline due to a process of degradation, mainly due to
repeated droughts from the 1970s to the 1980s, and overexploitation (see Section 5.1 Existing Conditions).
These areas affected by degradation have gone from hosting mangroves in good condition (with densities
of more than 2,500 trees/ha and average height of more than 6m) to degraded mangroves (with low
densities and low tree height), to finally becoming ‘tannes’ areas. The restoration activities will be carried
out in places of degraded mangroves or tannes, according to the previous classification.

The zonation of the vegetation observed close to the bolongs [27] is as follows [28] :

**2.1.6** **Social Parameters (G1.3)**

Senegal’s social indicators show an improvement in recent years. However, Senegal continues to be one
of the countries with the lowest Human Development Index [30] according to the UNDP [31] (HDI value 0.512 in
2019), being number 168 in the ranking of 189 countries.

The project takes place in two major locations: Sine-Saloum and Casamance. There are 17 communities
included in the project zone, 12 from Casamance and five from Sine-Saloum. Within the communes,
different villages are included. The total population of all the communities is 297,794 inhabitants based on
projections from the last census conducted in Senegal in 2014. [32 ]

***Casamance***

   - *Demographics*

Official demographic projections estimate the population of the 12 communes studied in the Casamance
area at 192,568 in 2022. In line with the national trend, the population of the 12 communes where the
project is being implemented is growing steadily. Between 2013 and 2022, the population of these 12
communes increased by 41%.

In all 12 communes covered by the project, density varies between 26 and 114 inhabitants per square
kilometer. The highest densities are found in the communes of Adeane, Bemet Bidjini and Djibabouya, with
values ranging from 59 to 114 inhabitants per square kilometer. They are followed by the communes of
Djinaky and Ouonk, with densities ranging from 52 to 58 inhabitants per square kilometer.

Settlement of Lower Casamance has been in phases over time. This explains the considerable diversity in
the ethnic composition of Lower Casamance. The Diolas are unquestionably the majority ethnic group. In
the Oussouye area, they are called "diolas kassa", unlike the "diolas Fogny" in Bignona. They represent
around 64% of the total population of the Ziguinchor region. In some villages, their representation can
approach 100%. Other ethnic groups found in the region include the Mandingue (4%), Fulani (9%), Serer
(2%), Wolof (5%), Balante (3%), Manjacque (4%) and Mancagnes (3%).

The Casamance has been affected by a low-intensity political conflict for 40 years. Since 1982, the
Movement of Democratic Forces of Casamance (MFDC) has claimed the region’s independence, and the
Senegalese Government has been fighting against that. People have migrated to Guinea Bissau, Gambia,
or Europe [33] (mainly Spain, France, and Italy). While unresolved, there is little record of this having a direct
impact on the project area. However, it has in the past caused some population movements, either voluntary

or forced.

***Casamance***

   - *Socio-economic activities*

**Agriculture** is the dominant activity in Casamance, as it is in all the project's 12 communes. Agriculture is
the main source of income for rural populations. There are two types of cultivation: in flood valleys and on
forest plateaus. Rice-growing in the lowlands and on the alluvial plains is the dominant agricultural activity.
In terms of cultivated area, yield and production, rice is the most important crop. In this region, rice is grown
using unmechanized techniques that are adapted to the environment. Rice cultivation takes place during
the rainy season (June to December).

## CCB & VCS PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

*CCB Version 3, VCS Version 3*

Millet is the second most important crop grown in the area. Other crops, such as groundnuts, maize,
sorghum, and cowpeas, are increasingly grown in the area linked to the decline in rainfall. These crops,
which are less demanding than rice in terms of water supply, are taking on significant proportions in the
lowlands and are helping to compensate for the shortfall in rice yields for some farmers.

The Ziguinchor region boasts an 85-km coastline and a major hydrographic network, including a 300-kmlong axial river and numerous bolongs, giving it a wealth of fishery resources and enormous potential for
marine, lagoon and river fishing.

With a landed catch of 69,372.722 tonnes in 2016, the Ziguinchor region ranks fourth in Senegal in terms
of fish production. The region's "exploitable fishery resources are estimated at 130,000 tonnes per year".
These resources, which are poorly exploited, consist mainly of coastal pelagic species, coastal and deepwater demersal species, and lagoon species in abundance in the bolongs and estuaries of the Casamance
River. Mangrove oysters can also be found.

   - *Economic analysis of the mangrove ecosystem in the 12 intervention communes in Casamance*

In order to gain a better understanding of the issues surrounding mangroves, a survey was carried out in
the 12 communes involved in the project in the Casamance area. The results showed that fishing, with a
rate of 57%, is by far the most common activity in Casamance; mangrove wood, in second place, is often
used to build traditional ceilings, or as energy wood, and sometimes even for fencing concessions. Then
there's oyster farming, an activity particularly practiced by women whose income is not to be overlooked; it
enables them to be financially independent from their husbands and, better still, to contribute to the
economic management of the household. Other lesser-known activities are also highlighted by the
interviewers were bee-keeping and traditional medicine.

***Sine-Saloum***

   - *Demographics*

Several ethnic groups live in the Saloum delta. The main ethnic group is the Serer, divided into two subgroups: the Serer living on the mainland and the Niominka living on the islands. Alongside this ethnic
majority, there are also Peulhs, Wolofs, Bambaras, Mandingues and others.

The population of the 5 communes in the MANCO project is growing, as is that of the country as a whole.
All 5 local authorities are experiencing rapid population growth. Between 2013 and 2022, the population of
the 5 communes rose from 73,881 to 99,892, an increase of 35% in a decade. This rapid population growth
is the result of natural increase, reinforced by migration.

Sine-Saloum is a region of great historical and cultural wealth. The Sine-Saloum takes its name from the
Saloum River and its main tributary, the Sine. It constitutes more than 70% of the groundnut basin.

The population of Sine-Saloum is essentially composed of the Serere (81.88%) and the Mandingues
(7.98%), but there are also Wolof (4.94%), Hal Pulaar (1.52%), Toucouleurs (1.39%), and others (Diolas,
Sarakolés, Lébous, Bassaris, Balantes, etc. – 2.29%).

Population density in the project's 5 communes more or less matches the national average of 88
inhabitants/Km². Indeed, in these communes, population density varies between 42 and 108 inhabitants
per square kilometer. The Fimela commune remains the most densely populated in the project area, with

a density of 108 inhabitants per square kilometer. It is followed by the communes of Mbam and Loul

Sessene.

*Figure 15: Population density of the 5 communes included in the project area in Sine-Saloum*

   - *Socio-economic activities carried out by the target population in the 5 project communes in Sine-*

*Saloum*

Several activities are carried out in the Saloum Delta. These are mainly fishing, agriculture and tourism.

Fishing is an essential activity in the development dynamic of the Saloum Delta populations. Not only does
it meet food needs, but it is also a means of generating income for fishermen.

Agriculture employs a very large proportion of the total population, close to 75% of the working population,
(PDC, 2016). The production system is based on annual rotation between cash crops and cereals in the
uplands, rice cultivation in the lowlands, and the development of market gardening in the valleys during the
dry season. Millet occupies first place in terms of cultivated area.

Tourism has developed over the years in this area, a development justified by the great potential offered
by the climate, the diversity of animal species and landscapes, and the cultural resources. The national
policy of diversifying tourist zones as much as possible has made the Saloum one of the preferred

destinations for international tourism.

Mangroves play a very important role in the local economic dynamics of the Saloum Delta. The results of
surveys carried out among the populations of the communes concerned revealed that fishing and oyster
farming are the activities most present in the mangrove ecosystem. Fish and oysters benefit from the
improved environmental conditions created by the combination of freshwater, saltwater and mangrove
vegetation.

Analysis of the distribution of mangrove-related activities by commune shows that fishing is present in all 5
communes in the project area, and is especially important in the communes of Djilasse and Loul Séssène.
It also remains the predominant sector in the commune of Mbam. In Fimela, on the other hand, oyster
farming dominates the fishing sector. Almost 70% of the commune's fishermen work in this sector. In the
commune of Djirnda, all activities (fishing, oyster farming, beekeeping, mangrove timber harvesting,
traditional medicine) related to the mangrove ecosystem are practiced, with fishing and timber harvesting
predominating.

***Governance Structures***

After independence, the State of Senegal, judging the indigenous and colonial land tenure regimes to be
inadequate with the new economic and social development requirements, promulgated a law on the
national domain in 1964 (Law 64-46 of 17 June 1964). The law, which is still in force, has created a national
domain whose regulations result in the State taking responsibility and an exclusive right of registration by
the State and local authorities on rural land (Guide Foncier DGL FELO, August 2004). The classified domain
belongs to the State, which may concede its exploitation to third parties based on a memorandum of
understanding. This category of the estate includes plantations under management. Thus, the State of
Senegal owns 97% of the land (including forests).

Forests, Hunting and Soil Conservation, and the Department of National Parks. These forests cover
about 7,143,579ha (FRA, 2005) and include classified forests, integral nature reserves, national
parks, and sylvo-pastoral reserves.

  - Protected Area **Forests** are the responsibility of the local authorities. These cover an area of
approximately 6,525,324ha (FRA, 2005).

There are very few privately owned forests in Senegal. In 2005, they covered an area of 5,099ha. There is
no private domain in the project zone.

The land planted or to be planted for this project belongs to the government. The communities have the
right to use public lands for different purposes: fishing (fish and oyster collection), rice, agriculture, and
livestock rearing.

**2.1.7** **Project Zone Map (G1.4-7, G1.13, CM1.2, B1.2)**

The first project activity instance consists of 7,019.8ha divided in the areas that are shown below. This area
corresponds to the project area, where project activities aim to generate net climate benefits.

*Table 2: Hectares and associated percentages in each location*

|Location|Ha|%|
|---|---|---|
|Sine Saloum|3,781.47|54|
|Casamance|3,238.33|46|
|TOTAL|7,019.79|100.0|



There have been signed agreements with the mayors of 17 communities, with the document including the
number of hectares to be restored. An addendum will be signed with communities at the end of the
reforestation activities to include exact amount of area restored and a detailed maps of the areas reforested
under the framework of this project. The Communes of Senegal are the fourth-level administrative divisions
in Senegal (below country, region, and department).

As can be observed in the table below, the surfaces included in each community have a wide range of
sizes, varying from the smallest at 0ha to the biggest at 1,713 ha.

phase of the MANCO programme (2020 - 2022). However, as the reforestation target was reached without
the Adéane reforestation, it was decided with the commune to postpone reforestation operations in the
commune during phase 2 (2023 - 2027).

As can be observed in Figures 5 and 6, every community has a wide administrative area and includes a
number of villages. Some of them have participated in the restoration activities because they are linked to
the mangrove or because they are close to the restoration areas. The socio-economic activities that will be
included in this project will also be developed in all the project communities.

The project zone is made up of the project area and the 17 communities with signed agreements. [36] Future
activity instances are expected to be within these communities.

The High Conservation Values (HCV) identified in the scope of the project are as follows:

         - HCV1: Project area inside the Sine-Saloum Biosphere Reserve. Communities of Djilass,
Fimela, and Loul Séssene

The Sine-Saloum Biosphere Reserve is a remarkable testimony to the synergy between a natural
environment with extensive biodiversity and a style of human development that is still present. The
Biosphere reserve is characterized by a great diversity of habitats, including savannah, mangrove, sandy
islets, lagoons and shorelines. For instance, the region is home to a quarter of the world's population of
King Terns (Sterna maxima albidorsalis). Bird Island is also the world's first hibernation and breeding site
for this endangered species.

         - HCV1: Project area inside the Niamone Kalounaye Marine Protected Area (MPA).

Communities of Coubalan and Ouonck

The Niamone Kalounayes Community Marine Protected Area covers the communes of Ouonck and
Coubalan. This protected area is home to a diversity of reptiles (Nile crocodiles, Nile monitors, land
tortoises), marine mammals (dolphins and manatees), birdlife (pink flamingos, grey pelicans, egrets,
Gambian geese, grayling) and flora (mangroves, forests, grassy savannahs).

         - HCV6: Gandoul Community Marine Protected Area (Fatick region)
The Gandoul Community Marine Protected Area covers the communes of Djirnda and Mbam. This
protected area is home to a diversity of marine and coastal resources (arches, prawns, murex, fish,
cymbium, oysters, dolphins, manatees, etc.), forests ( *Rhizophora spp* . and *Avicennia spp* .), prosopis

36 CCB Standard version 3.1. The project zone is defined as the area encompassing the project area in which project
activities that directly affect land and associated resources, including activities such as those related to provision of
alternative livelihoods and community development, are implemented. For grouped projects, the project zone also
includes all potential project areas (i.e. all potential new land areas in which project activities that aim to generate net
climate benefits may be implemented in the future after the initial validation).

(Prosopis juliflora), baobab (Adansonia digitata), tamarind (Tamarindus indica) and acacia (Acacia nilotica).
Lastly, this protected area is home to other animal resources, including jackal, monkey, hyena and serval.

         - HCV6: Mangagoulack community heritage area (Ziguinchor region)

The Mangagoulack community heritage area covers 9665 hectares, or 30% of the Mangagoulack
commune. This protected area is the fruit of the efforts of a number of local fishermen, who came together
to form an association to combat the degradation of the mangrove forests, and in particular to work together
to rebuild the area in which they live.

The Kawanana APAC is made up of estuarine mangrove dotted with canals (Bolong) and the main
ecological functions maintained by the APAC are those of ecosystem protection and regeneration.

There are no predicted areas with off-site climate impacts.

The areas where other stakeholders will be impacted are described in Section 4.3. During the lifetime of
the project, awareness will be created through involved stakeholders. This project could have a positive
impact on the use of natural resources in Casamance made by Malians, Burkinabes, and Guinean
fishermen since it is also expected to include them as stakeholders. Other impacted stakeholders could be

the tourists in Sine-Saloum and Casamance areas.

Since the project proponent and implementer are in contact with researchers and scientific committees, it
is expected that an additional benefit of the project will be to provide new knowledge regarding the
restoration and conservation of mangroves.

The areas where off-site biodiversity impacts are predicted are described in Section 5.3.

**2.1.8** **Stakeholder Identification (G1.5)**

A stepwise approach was taken to stakeholder identification that involved:

1) Identification of potential key stakeholders
2) Characterisation of potential key stakeholders
3) Selection of key stakeholders to be engaged
4) Continual reassessment of key stakeholders throughout project development

Stakeholders were identified under three categories: participant communities, regulatory gateways, and
other interest groups and technical partners.

*Community stakeholders:*

A major focus of stakeholder identification has been the identification, characterisation, and selection of
participant communities. The project area was selected by (i) a field study to identify the degraded areas to
be reforested and (ii) the subsequent agreement with the mayor to be involved in the project [37] . At the local
level, discussions were held with the mayors of the communities concerned in the identification of sites to
be reforested. The mayors were also involved in reforestation and mobilization of the communities. An
agreement with each mayor was signed from May to June 2020 to identify plantation areas in each
community and define the carbon credit retrocession. As mentioned in Section 2.1.7, 17 agreements have
been signed with the mayors [38] .

Between January and April 2020, Oceanium conducted a survey among the communities to understand
the role played by mangroves in the project area and to better understand community expectations.

## CCB & VCS PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

*CCB Version 3, VCS Version 3*

Oceanium field staff, together with village chiefs, identified the local organizations and individuals to be
involved in the project. In each of the communities, a questionnaire was submitted to three people [39] : an
elected municipal official, a youth representative, and a women’s representative. The mayors and elected
officials directed the Oceanium teams to the most appropriate people to survey because of their
responsibilities (president of an association, president of an economic grouping, etc.).

The objectives of this survey were to collect the following information [40] : (i) the perception of the communities
of the project area on the ecosystem functions of the mangrove, its degradation factors, the mechanisms
of its own development; (ii) the level of adhesion of the communities to a mangrove restoration; and (iii) the
activities to be developed to contribute to the development of their territory.

The key stakeholders identified at community / department level were:

  - Stakeholders at community or village level: mayors of the communities (17), village chiefs, and
environmental committees in the communities, the governor at the regional level, and steering
committees. This group includes different social groups linked to mangroves, such as women who
collect oysters, beekeepers, fishermen, young people, etc.

  - Associations linked to different activities such as fishing, oystering, beekeeping, etc.: local
committee of artisanal fisheries, shrimp collectors, the AMPs Gestion Committee, and other
producers’ organizations.

  - Sportive and cultural associations

  - Religious leaders

  - Opinion leaders

*Regulatory Gateways:*

As land is a public domain, exchanges took place with the government of Senegal, particularly, the Ministry
of Environment and Sustainable Development. These exchanges concerned the tripartite agreement and
the modalities of institutional support that the project could contribute to.

The stakeholders identified were:

  - Public authorities: marine community-based protected area departments, the Water and Forest,
Hunting and Soil Conservation Department, Directorate for the Environment and Classified
Establishments, Regional Governor, National Committee on Climate Change.

*Other interest groups and technical partners:*

In addition to the local communities, other selected stakeholders were consulted as part of the project
design for the restoration activities.

The identification of actors from academic research was carried out on the recommendations of the

Directorate of Environment and Classified Institutions (which depends on the Ministry of Environment and
Sustainable Development – abbreviated in French as MEDD) [41] .

The stakeholders identified were:

  - Other NGOs or associations: Headteachers’ Collective (CODEC in French), CAREM, other NGOs
working in national and international projects in the area, such as Project AMP-Mangrove (French
development agency, IUCN – projet régional pour le renforcement de la protection des
écosystèmes de mangroves en Afrique de l’Ouest, Provale (African development bank) –
implemented in four Senegalese regions, including Fatick; association of young people,
associations of women linked to fishing activities, etc.

  - Education and research organizations: Assane Seck of Ziguinchor (agroforestry department),
ISRA, Dakar Soil Institute, and Dakar UCAD.

  - Tourist operators (including hotels, guides / canoeists, artists / creators).

Further information on the stakeholders consulted and the discussions are available as supporting
documentation [42] .

*Livelihoods support stakeholders:*

Three field visits were performed to identify and contact various associations and local groups related with
livelihood activities [43] . The livelihood activities will focus on local organizations that are already involved in
the honey and oyster sectors.

*Stakeholder identification for SBIA participation:*

Based on this previous work, selected stakeholders were invited to participate in the Social and Biodiversity
Impact Assessment (SBIA) workshop [44], to which all the representatives of the project stakeholders group
were invited. The selection of the representatives was based on their role (mayor, president of an

**2.1.9** **Stakeholder Descriptions (G1.6, G1.13)**

From the stakeholder identification process outlined in Section 2.1.8, a set of key stakeholders with interest
in, influence over, or affected by the project activities. Oceanium has been working with different local
stakeholders for years, which implies a good knowledge about different stakeholder groups. The mangrove
is a public asset owned by the Senegalese Government, and the communities have the right to access and
#### 48

CCB v3.0, VCS v3.3


-----

## CCB & VCS PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

*CCB Version 3, VCS Version 3*

use its resources. The only condition to access the mangrove is to have the means for access; for example,
women need the money to rent a boat to enter into the mangrove. Mayors grant the villagers the right to
use village land for cultivation, and if families are not cultivating the land, they have to give it back to the
city hall. Apart from commercial activities, people also access the mangrove to collect dead wood, honey,
oysters, and fishing for household consumption.

The different identified stakeholders are mentioned below:

1. Mayors of communities

Reforestation will take place in 17 communities. These communities are administered by an elected mayor
and assisted by an elected city council. The election of the mayor and deputies takes place by secret ballot
and absolute majority. There are five communities involved in the Sine-Saloum project zone (Djilass,
Djirnda, Fimela, Mbam, Loul and Sessene) and 12 in Casamance (Adéane, Bemet, Coubalan, Djibabouya,
Djinaki, Enampore, Kafountine, Mangangoulack, Nyassia, Oukout, Ouonk, and Santhiaba Manjack). The
agreements with each mayor specify the number of hectares that will be reforested in this first project
activity instance and the percentage of carbon credits that will be returned. Mayors play a relevant role in
involving the communities in reforestation operations.

For the implementation of reforestation projects within the communes, it is necessary to have the validation
and commitment of the mayors of the communes who are representing their inhabitants (community). This
is why agreements between Oceanium and the mayors of the communes have been signed.

Mayors play an important role in reforestation activities. Being signatories of the agreements, they get the
information about the actions planned in their local authorities. One month before the start of the
reforestation campaign [47], the project organizes an information, awareness, and preparation tour for
reforestation activities. During this tour they will also take the opportunity to request the opinion and
recommendations of the administrative authorities (sub-prefect, prefect, and governor) and also of other
stakeholders (water and forest directorate, community marine-protected areas, associations, etc.). An
update on planning and achievements, and implementation difficulties, as well as the first results on the
survival rate, will be presented and shared.

2. Government institution at department level

The public institution personnel involved in the project at the governmental level are the regional governors
and the prefects of the departments.

For Sine-Saloum, the administrative authority for the region is the governor of the Fatick region. The two
departmental prefects involved in the project are in charge of the administrative management of the Fatick
and Foundiougne departments [48] .

For the Casamance zone, the governors of Ziguinchor and Sedhiou represent the State at the regional
level. The prefects of Bignona, Oussouye, and Ziguinchor are involved as representatives of the State in
these departments.

3. Government institutions at national level

COMNACC

The National Committee on Climate Change (COMNACC) is a body for coordination, consultation, training,
sensitization, management, and monitoring of the various activities identified in the framework of the
implementation of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and its additional legal

instruments.

The COMNACC will play an information, sensitization, training, and facilitation role in designing, financing,
implementing, validating, and monitoring, sub-regional and regional programs, and projects relating to the
priority areas referred to in Article 4 of DECREE n° 2011-1689 of October 3, 2011 for establishing the
National Committee on Climate Change. [49]

It will ensure the consistency of programs and projects with national objectives relating to climate change
at the level of mitigation. In this regard, the Directorate of Environment, Designated National Climate
Authority (DNA) shall be kept informed and involved in all projects submitted in the carbon markets [50] .

The Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development prepares and implements the policy defined by
the Head of State in terms of environmental monitoring, pollution control and protecting nature, fauna and
flora. This Ministry is responsible for the protection and, as such, it takes measures to prevent and combat
pollution of all kinds. It ensures that potentially polluting activities do not jeopardize the living environment
of the community and the quality of the environment. To achieve this goal, the Ministry is composed of
several thematic directorates in charge of various portfolios.

The Ministry areas covered by our project are: (i) the Water and Forests, Hunting and Soil Conservation
Directorate (WFHSCD); (ii) the Environment and Classified Establishments Directorate; and (iii) the
Community Marine Protected Areas Directorate.

## CCB & VCS PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

*CCB Version 3, VCS Version 3*

Water and Forests, Hunting and Soil Conservation Directorate

The WFHSCD is responsible for the development and implementation of national forestry policy. It
exercises the prerogatives of the State in the areas of soil conservation, wildlife management, and forest
ecosystems. The main objectives of the forestry policy are to ensure, on the one hand, the sustainable
management of forest potential and its biodiversity and, on the other, the satisfaction of the needs of the
communities for forest goods and services, and the maintenance of socio-economic and ecological

balances.

The WFHSCD will support the project through technical support and that of its decentralized structures,
within the limits of the resources made available, in the following areas: sensitization of actors, facilitation
of the acquisition and transport of planting materials. This support will focus on constructing an intervention
framework for the implementation of activities on environmental education and sustainable development
focused on the preservation of mangrove areas. In addition, the Directorate of Water, Forestry, Hunting and
Soil Conservation (DEFCCS) will participate in plantation monitoring missions in areas outside MPAs.

Community Marine Protected Areas Directorate

The objective of the Community Marine Protected Areas Directorate (CMPAD) is to contribute to national
poverty reduction strategies through sustainable marine spatial management.

The CMPAD will provide technical support and that of its decentralized structures in and around MPAs,
within the limits of the resources made available. This support will focus on constructing an intervention
framework for the implementation of activities on environmental education and sustainable development
focused on the preservation of mangrove areas. It will facilitate the mobilization of the populations in
planting activities, monitoring, and follow-up. In addition, the Directorate of Community Marine Protected
Areas (DAMCP) will participate in missions to monitor in situ plantations and the preservation of restored
mangrove areas. Thus, the project will contribute to the technical capacity building of its agents involved in
the process.

Environment and Classified Establishments Directorate

The Environment and Classified Establishments Directorate acts as the focal point for the United Nations
Framework Convention On Climate Change (UNFCCC) and also as the DNA for the implementation of the
Kyoto Protocol and Article 6.4 of the Paris Agreement, carbon market mechanisms in the fight against
climate change, and is responsible for ensuring compliance and transparency in the implementation of
national commitments, including the Determined Contribution at the National level (CDN).

Within the framework of this project, the Direction de l'Environnement et des Etablissements Classés DEEC
will ensure compliance with the implementation of the tripartite agreement on behalf of the government of
Senegal and will oversee the completion of the environmental assessment of the project and the
implementation of the related environmental management framework. It will also support, in collaboration
with the National Committee on Climate Change, all verification and certification operations, and the
avoidance of double counting of emission credits, within the limits of available means.

4. Sports and cultural associations (SCAs)

SCAs are present in all the villages surveyed and are very often linked to the village soccer teams. A
national soccer tournament, called Nawetan, takes place every year during the winter period. Villages from
all over the country are represented, and winning this tournament is a source of pride for the inhabitants.
For example, the Marssassoum team won the tournament in 2013, and this victory is a source of pride for
the inhabitants. SCA members are mainly young people between the ages of 25 and 39.

The practice of soccer and participation in Nawetans seems to be the main objective of the SCAs in the
villages we visited. To be able to register and participate in the various matches across the country, Civil
Society Organization (CSO) members: (i) do agricultural work in the villagers’ fields; or (ii) participate in
reforestation operations.

5. Economic interest groups (EIG)

An EIG is established by a written contract between two or more natural or legal persons for a specified
period, establishing a legal framework to develop the economic activity.

The EIGs carry out various activities: soap production, oyster collection, collection and processing of nontimber forest products, salt collection, and selling and market gardening seem to be the main activity carried
out by the EIGs.

**2.1.10 Sectoral Scope and Project Type**

This project is a grouped project for the ARR (with WRC) of degraded wetlands in Senegal. For the first
project activity instance, the project will restore 7,019.8ha.

Sectoral scope: Agriculture, Forestry, and Other Land Use

Project Category: Afforestation, Reforestation, and/or Revegetation (ARR) with Wetlands Restoration and
Conservation (WRC)

Activity type: Restoring wetland ecosystems and enrichment and regeneration of native forest (ARR+RWE)

Project type: Grouped project

**2.1.11 Project Activities and Theory of Change (G1.8)**

The project’s overall objective is to reverse the trends in degradation and restore degraded mangroves to
bring back valuable ecosystems and productivity, improve soil quality, contribute to the fight against climate
change, and rehabilitate ecosystem services. With the restoration of 7,019.8ha in degraded mangrove
areas, about 1.4 million tons of CO 2 -e would be mitigated in the 30 years of project implementation. In

addition to this climate objective, the project also focuses on improving local communities and biodiversity
(see project objectives in Section 2.1.1 Summary Description of the project).

The achievement of these objectives follows the principles of sustainable development, agreed in the 2030
Agenda, and the Paris Agreement, defined at the COP21 Climate Summit, where it was agreed not to
exceed 2ºC of the temperature recorded in the pre-industrial era. In this sense, this project will be able to
contribute to these global goals, which would not happen in a scenario without a project. In this way, if the
project is not executed, the land will continue in a state of degradation. Thus, GHG emissions would not be
mitigated, community benefits would not be generated, and biodiversity would remain in poor condition.

*Figure 19: Theory of Change within the framework of the entire project*

Annex 1 provides a summary description of each project activity and the expected output, outcomes, and
impacts using a Theory of Change to explain how the activities will achieve the project’s predicted climate,

The sub-activities included in the mentioned activities are described below:

**A.** **Mangrove restoration activities**

Oceanium has a long tradition of planting mangroves with local communities and has forged a relationship
of trust and partnership with various grassroots community organizations at the village, municipal,
departmental, and regional levels. In addition, the project collaborates with youth associations and SCAs.
The strategy put in place is that each structure reforests its own locality with the support of the technicians
of the PP and implementation partners.

A.1. Identification of mangrove planting sites

The site identification process goes through several stages. These different phases allow all the possibilities

of successful reforestation.

   - After the agreement is signed with the communities, reconnaissance of potential areas is
carried out with the local technical services and findings are presented to the government team

of the communities.

   - A team made up of municipal councilors, members of an environment commission, and
officials from the interested towns, will be in charge of visiting the site to give their opinion on

the selected area.

A.2. Collection of propagules and nursery

Mangrove reforestation with *Rhizophora* is done with propagules and *Avicennia spp.* reforestation is done
with seedlings produced in the nursery. For the collection of *Rhizophora* propagules, on-site training
collection techniques will be organized so that local residents can collect the most suitable propagules
which should be mature and in good condition.

A.3. Design of plantations according to local ecological conditions and selected species

The most suitable species, as well as the planting conditions and the places of origin, will be decided locally
and for each plantation area. In this way, the adaptation of the planted species and their durability over time

is ensured.

A.4. Mangrove plantation process

This activity includes: a) the relationship with the mayors and local authorities one month before the planting
activity, for the preparation and awareness of the tasks to be carried out; b) hiring local people for the

planting campaign [51] ; c) training of the local people hired in (C.1.) Forest planting and management, and
(C.2.) HSSE.

A.5. Follow - up and replacement of dead trees in the first five years

The project's reforestation will be regularly monitored. Plots with high mortality rates or low densities will be
replaced, remediated or replanted with *Avicennia and Rhizophora spp* . in order to make the reforestation

more resilient to drought.

***B.*** **Identification and protection of not reforested areas inside the project area to conserve**

**habitat for waders**

Within the plantation areas there are areas to be potentially conserved due to the possible importance in
the feeding of the waders. In this way, a currently existing habitat is conserved and a greater diversity of
habitats and species is promoted.

***C.*** **Awareness campaign**

C.1. Local stakeholders ’ identification likely impacted by the project

The project team will take into account the stakeholders likely to be impacted by the project, integrating
them into the awareness-raising objectives, as well as in the participation and training tasks, if applicable.
Sections 2.1.8 and 2.1./9 detail this stakeholder identification process in more detail.

C.2. The signing of agreements

Taking into account the communities that have plantation areas within their territories, collaboration
agreements have been signed between them and WeForest. An agreement has also been signed with the
government of Senegal (who owns the land), to carry out the project without legal impediments. This project
aims to return 10% of the benefits generated by the sale of carbon credits to the communities so that they
can also enjoy the benefits of managing their resources. This fact is reflected in each of the signed
agreements. Further information on the 10% is found in D.4 of this section.

CCB projects have a strong commitment to the participation and involvement of stakeholders affected by
the project. In this sense, the project follows the principles of access to information, consultation, and
advice, participation in decision-making, non-discrimination, feedback and grievance redress procedure,
and respect for workers’ rights, with equal opportunities and correct training.

51 There is an Oceanium recruitment policy to ensure transparent hiring with equal opportunities for local
residents, as well as to seek to integrate gender equality in hiring and to follow the Safety, Health and
Environmental care standards during tasks. plantation. See recruitment policy in supporting documentation.

## CCB & VCS PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

*CCB Version 3, VCS Version 3*

The project will create and manage one national and two regional project steering committees. The steering
committees will be tasked with organizing and structuring all communities to participate in information and
decision-making.

C.3. Elaboration and implementation of communication and consultation plan

Complementing the previous activity, and as an instrument for the transfer of information between all the
stakeholders, a Communication and Consultation Plan will be implemented, which consists of the following

elements:

a) Radio broadcasts to disseminate information about the project

b) Cinema debate to inform about the project

c) Disseminate communication materials

d) The SBIA workshop

e) The Oceanium representatives in each community act as a focal point and can receive and disseminate
the information in the villages they work in.

Cinema debates and radio podcasts are the main channels of information to the residents of the villages in
the communities selected for the project. This way of reaching the population is the most accepted and
ensures the vast majority of people in participatory communities are sensitized to project objectives. It is
planned to carry out around 15 of these activities per year (cinema debate and radio podcast).

C.4. Development of workshop before the validation event

WeForest has organized two participative workshops, one in Sine-Saloum and the other in Casamance [52] .
These workshops have been organized to present the project and to discuss with the stakeholders (mayor,
government representatives, representatives of various types of organizations, etc.) the focal points of the
project: social and biodiversity projections under a without-project land-use scenario, the activities, impacts,
indicators, and risks of the project.

These workshops have promoted a dynamic exchange and dialogue between all stakeholders to ensure
their effective participation in the harmonization, planning, implementation of activities, and evaluation of
local initiatives around the mangrove.

C.5. Establishment of a grievance procedure before the validation event

***D.*** **Supporting resources on sustainable use (oysters, beekeeping, fishery, non** **-** **timber**

**products, etc.)**

The project has among its objectives to improve the well-being of local communities by creating job
opportunities, increasing available natural resources, improving livelihoods, and enhancing the capacities
of resident women and men. In seeking sustainable development, social peace, a correct distribution of
benefits and future well-being that ensure the permanence and success of the project, the following
activities will be carried out to promote the local economy and livelihoods:

                    D.1. Study and define income generating activities

To improve the supply chains of products from natural resources available in the territory, the project will
study available markets and subsequently design income-generating project activities.

This activity aims to:

`o` know the market, actors, and the opportunities for the communities
`o` increase the knowledge on method of production
`o` improve the relationship between producers and buyers
`o` create alternative livelihood opportunities, including within the mangrove planting sites

D.2. Support sustainable use of resources

Build capacity for communities to implement sustainable harvesting and production of fish, beekeeping,
oysters, salt, non-timber products, etc.

This activity aims to provide:

`o` fair and equitable distribution to local residents of mangrove products and benefits
`o` reduction of salinity rates

`o` reduction of the risk of erosion

`o` an increase in the value of the land (due to use), greater presence of local residents for
exploitation, greater vigilance to train the foreigners on local rules for resources
management

D.3. Investment in the oyster supply chain
#### 57

CCB v3.0, VCS v3.3

## CCB & VCS PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

*CCB Version 3, VCS Version 3*

The project will be involved in improving the capacity and quality of the supply chain supported by the
project, through the improvement of community structures and organizations, gender equality, and correct

distribution of benefits.

This investment in the oyster value chain aims to:

`o` generate income
`o` increase, improve and equilibrate the yearly household incomes
`o` increase the value and quantity of oysters

D.4. 10% revenue sharing generated by the sale of carbon credits

Ten percent of the carbon credits generated, in relation to the hectares of each community, will be returned
to them. The modality for sale and revenue sharing will be defined by the National Steering Committee to
be established by the Senegalese Government. The steering committees will ensure a correct distribution
of these funds in beneficial development projects for the community. This activity is directly related to an
equitable distribution of the benefits of the project.

***E.*** **Scientific research activities**

Because there is a lack of existing knowledge about good sustainable use of mangroves and associated
resources, as well as ecosystem services and well-being for local communities, and the immediate threat
of climate change, the project will use the best knowledge and the best techniques available. Therefore,
the following actions will be executed:

   - eDNA study: to characterise the diversity of species present in the ecosystem in which we
operate

   - Soil carbon study

   - Flux towers: To measure greenhouse gas exchange in the project area by installing three flux
towers. The use of Eddy covariance allows direct measurement, at ecosystem or site level, of
land-atmosphere exchanges of carbon dioxide and methane.

   - High Resolution Drones images: To monitor the plantation and to use it as decision making

tool for remediation activities

   - Mini buoys: The Mini-Buoy is a tool to assess hydrological site suitability (inundation and tidal
currents) for mangrove restoration. The mini-bouys will help for site identification and survival
rate causes analysis.

***F.*** **Surveillance monitoring**
#### 58

by the ecosystem services are a long-term incentive for maintaining the mangrove and its climate,
community, and biodiversity benefits.

Therefore, at the end of the project, the communities’ own interests and investment, along with the
governance structure (the steering committee) created for the purpose of this project, will continue the
management for the benefit of all people.

The correct implementation of the project, taking into account all potential risks and adaptation to climate
change, through a careful selection of species and plantation sites, contribute to the resilience of the
plantations beyond the project lifetime.

The MANCO project is designed to play an important role in socio-economic development and the
preservation and enhancement of the mangrove ecosystem in Casamance and Sine-Saloum. On the
environmental front, the project will promote better preservation of natural areas and wetlands that are
currently under serious threat. The planting of mangroves in the Sine-Saloum and Casamance estuaries
will protect the land against marine and coastal erosion by forming a natural barrier against marine currents.

The resilience of the restored mangroves to future threats will be increased through including Avicennia
species, especially through remediation planting. Avicennia species tend to be more resilient to
environmental pressures that have affected the region in the past.

**2.1.20 Financial Sustainability (G1.12)**

The costs of project activities will be fully financed by the sale of the carbon credits. This is based on
thorough financial analysis. WeForest is engaging with market buyers to identify suitable financiers for the
project and Phase 1 planting is being funded by an organisation intending to purchase the credits who
would otherwise not invest in a project of this type.

In addition, further actions have been taken to ensure the financial sustainability of the project:

a) The communities by means of the steering committee will receive 10% of the revenue of the carbon
credits sold. These funds will be used to improve the wellbeing of the communities implementing projects
related to education, health, infrastructure, etc.

b) The project will support communities in economic development through the sustainable use of natural
resources, improving production chains, and their access to markets (see activities C1, C2, and C3 in
Section 2.1.11: Project Activities and Theory of Change).

## CCB & VCS PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

*CCB Version 3, VCS Version 3*

**2.1.21 Grouped Projects**

**1) Eligibility Criteria for Grouped Projects (G1.14)**

The project proposes a first instance of 7,019.8 hectares to be reforested. However, the final scaling limits
are expected to be about 17,000 hectares. For the expansion, the activities, technologies, and measures
will be adopted in the same way as for the project description.

The eligibility criteria for expansion are as follows:

   - New project instances should be designed in accordance with applicable VCS requirements and
methodologies as per the first instance.

   - New project instances should be located within the Sine-Saloum and Casamance estuaries in
Senegal, as per the first instance.

   - The crediting period for new project instances will be the same as for the first instance.

   - The baseline scenario for new project instances will be the same as, or more conservative than,
the baseline scenario for the first project instance and in accordance with the regulations set out
for the applicable methodology.

   - The social parameters at the project activity instance start date will be similar to those described
for the first project activity instance.

   - The same project proponent and project partners will be involved in implementing new project
instances as for the first project instance, and should have appropriate capacity to do so effectively.

   - New project instances will fall under the same MRV system for coherent reporting.

   - New project instances must be aligned with the proposed governance structure for the project.

   - The planting area historically used to be mangrove (see section 2.1.5). Degraded areas will be
considered for future plantations if they have maintained their degraded condition for more than 20
years and are more than 8m away from other plantations. The technologies and identification
methods will be the same as for the present project.

   - In the case of incorporating new communities into the project, the same process will be followed
as for those currently involved: 1) previous meetings, 2) joint selection of stakeholders, 3) joint
selection of plots to be reforested, 4) signature of the agreements.

   - Project Activities and Theory of Change are maintained during the expansion. In this way, the
agreements signed with the government and the communities, the implementation of the steering
committees and communication activities, among others, are maintained.

   - In the case of new villages to be incorporated, they will be involved in the same way as the first
instance, incorporating them into the cinema debate, radio podcast, steering committees, and
monitoring plan, among others.

   - New instances should be subject to consultation processes similar to those carried out for the first
instance in terms of respect for land tenure and rights of use, such as compliance with the free and
informed prior consultation process.

#### 71

CCB v3.0, VCS v3.3


-----

## CCB & VCS PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

*CCB Version 3, VCS Version 3*

The limitations for expansion are as follows:

a) New plantation areas will be placed in the 17 communities in the Sine-Saloum and Casamance estuaries
with which there are signed agreements.

b) The choice will be limited to the expansion of the mangrove swamp from other projects, keeping a
distance with these and always taking into account the technical criteria on the success of the plantations.

c) The initial forecast is that around 17,000 total hectares is available for scoping, including consideration

of the sea level rise assessment.

3) **Risk Mitigation Approach for Grouped Projects (G1.15)**

The risks identified must be reassessed and updated when new project instances are incorporated. Thus,
the risk matrix will incorporate the risks associated with the expansion.

To further reduce risks of adding project instances, and ensure continuing effectiveness and robustness of
the project, the following aspects will be taken into account:

   - Prior to expansion of the project to new instances, a full financial analysis and capacity assessment
will be undertaken to ensure that the project proponent and implementing partners are able to
implement new project instances to the same quality as the first project instance.

   - Project expansion plans will be presented to the WeForest Board to provide an additional layer of
independent oversight.

   - WeForest will work with local partners on the ground to build their capacity to expand the project.

   - The project will implement a robust data monitoring and data storage system that can cope with
additional demands of new project instances.

   - Effective stakeholder communication will be conducted to ensure that new and existing project
stakeholders understand the process, rationale, and implications of incorporating new project

instances.

   - The national and international regulatory environment will be regularly assessed to ensure project
compliance.
##### **2.2 Without-project Land-Use Scenario and Additionality **

**2.2.1** **Land-use Scenarios without the Project (G2.1)**

The sites to be reforested are degraded mangrove areas with some pre-existing mangrove species (see
figure below). The conditions existing prior to project initiation were identified as the most likely scenario.
For more details, see Section 3.1.4 Baseline Scenario, where it is explained that the continuation of the
pre-project land use, land remaining as a degraded wetland, is established as the baseline scenario.

*Figure 20: Scenario without project*

In the Sine-Saloum Biosphere Reserve (SSBR) and the Casamance estuary, the sites chosen to be
reforested are practically bare (tannes) with limited mangrove plants signaling that the landscape is suitable
for mangrove restoration (Photo below). These sites are suitable areas for the development of certain
mangrove species including *Rhizophora spp* . and *Avicennia spp* . as seen in the surrounding areas where
there are large expanses of relatively dense mangroves consisting mainly of *Rhizophora spp.* and *Avicennia*

## CCB & VCS PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

*CCB Version 3, VCS Version 3*

Analysis of the basic environmental and social conditions in the project area shows that the project's area
of influence is still strongly marked by a continuing process of environmental and natural resource
degradation, primarily as a result of drought in the 1980s, and in some cases the use of unsustainable
production systems e.g. unsustainable oyster harvesting techniques. The project area is marked by
mangrove degradation, with major consequences for the reduction of biodiversity, despite the significant
interventions and efforts of the State and various development partners and NGOs to regenerate and
enhance the mangroves.

The option of not carrying out the project would mean maintaining this status quo. The project's failure to
intervene in the sub-sectors of aquaculture, fishing, the collection of non-timber forest products and
beekeeping would mean not resolving the precariousness and vulnerability affecting the populations of the
area, and not acting on the ongoing process of degradation of natural resources.

"Doing nothing" would also mean failing to respond to the erosion of biological diversity caused by the
degradation of natural resources and the mangrove ecosystem. This alternative would therefore not be in
line with the environmental protection and sustainable development objectives advocated by Senegal and
its development partners.

The "no project" alternative itself has a number of negative impacts and effects (lower incomes; increased
emigration, more conflicts; further degradation of natural resources, etc.).

In addition, the scenario without a project was intensively discussed in the SBIA workshops with the
communities, where the following conclusions were obtained:

  - Traditional exploitation of mangrove products would continue. The deforestation around the
plantation sites would continue, and some mangrove species would disappear. Mangrove decline
would cause a decrease in the amount of fishing available so that the benefits to the communities
would decrease. Also, in the absence of the mangrove, salinization would increase, and rice
paddies and wildlife habitat would disappear.

  - The communities do not have the financial and technical means to reforest in a large-scale project

such as this one.

  - In the absence of the project, in the medium term (3-5 years), shellfish and fisheries would continue,
but without mangroves as nurseries for fish, population numbers are likely to decline.

**2.2.2** **Most-likely Scenario Justification (G2.1)**

The most-likely scenario is explored in more detail in Section 3.2.1. The most likely scenario is the continued
existence of degraded mangroves without significant restoration. The main evidence for the continuity of
degradation lies in the fact that, after their degradation (mostly in the 1980s when the area experienced
severe droughts) these areas have not recovered.

To make a correct selection of areas in which to plant the plantations, the project prepared the ‘Study of
eligibility of land inside the project boundary of the project: Mangrove Restoration Program with SineSaloum and Casamance communities, Senegal Grouped Project’ using remote sensing analysis tools. In

it, it was evidenced that the areas selected for reforestation are degraded and have been for at least the
last 20 years. In that sense, they will most likely continue to be degraded areas in the future, in the case of
the without-project scenario.

**2.2.3** **Community and Biodiversity Additionality (G2.2)**

As mentioned in Section 3.1.5 this project would not occur in the absence of a VCS project activity. In the
absence of the project, the most likely scenario would be continuation of pre-project existing conditions.

The detailed additionality assessment was demonstrated by using the ‘Combined tool to identify the
baseline scenario and demonstrate additionality in A/R CDM project activities, v1.0’ – please refer to
Section 3.1.5 for details. Project activities would not have been implemented under the without-project
scenario due to technological, investment, local ecological conditions, as well as social barriers. Therefore,
the community and biodiversity benefits would not have the opportunity to occur either. Despite the
existence of national laws and regulations to protect the environment (see Section 2.5.7),  deforestation
and illegal activities such as poaching or logging are expected to occur.

According to the Ministry of the Environment, in its national strategy for biodiversity, [62] the operationalization
of this strategy emphasizes that the preservation of biodiversity and the improvement of the living conditions
of the population cannot be achieved without the active involvement of all stakeholders. These stakeholders
must work closely with a National Biodiversity Committee with real powers and adequate resources, and
participate fully in the effective implementation of the strategy’s action plan. The State of Senegal is
struggling to mobilize the necessary resources for the implementation of its action plan. In the withoutproject scenario, the implementation of the national biodiversity strategy will be limited due to lack of
resources and support from projects and programs.

In Section 3.1.4 it is demonstrated that the project activities would not have been implemented under the
without-project scenario due to significant financial, technological, institutional, or capacity barriers.

##### **2.3 Stakeholder Engagement **

**2.3.1** **Stakeholder Access to Project Documents (G3.1)**

The project’s communication strategy will proceed through an integrated approach using various channels
in synergy in order to multiply the points of contact with the intended target(s) and to ensure that the
messages conveyed are consistent in content and form.

For stakeholders who can read, the project document as narrative reports, monitoring reports, and other
project documents will be distributed to project relevant stakeholders. The documents will be sent by email
(for those who have an email address) or given as a paper version via Oceanium officers. For those who
cannot read, a summary of the documents has been shared through radio broadcast and cinema debates.
Local languages will be used where appropriate.

The main forms of media to communicate project information to stakeholders include:

  - Radio podcasts. Community radios are one of the most suitable means of communication to inform
the population, as they are often listened to even in the most remote places and have the advantage
of being broadcast in local languages. Interactive radio broadcasts also allow for calls from listeners
to share their opinions on the subject matter. In the first series of radio broadcasting (from February
2021), communities were informed about the project’s key issues and had the opportunity to raise
their questions. In the next sessions and podcast, the communities will continue to be informed of
the most notable progress and events, as well as, where appropriate, the opportunities for

involvement.

  - Cinema debates. This consists of a film screening followed by a debate about the film [63] . Within the
framework of the project, the film will deal with the topics that the project wishes to discuss with the
participants. The video must capture attention and convey simple, relevant messages in an
accessible vocabulary and with images that the general public can understand. The cinema debate
is an opportunity for assembly meetings in each community. During the debates, the progress of
the project is presented, as well as complaints, claims, and recommendations, and other needs
from the community will be heard. In the cinema debates, carried out since March 2021, a general
presentation of the project has been provided; the implementation team and their roles.

  - Participatory workshops. The CCB standards require that project proponents describe the socioeconomic and biodiversity conditions at the project site and explain what these conditions would
be in the presence and absence of the project. The SBIA workshop has been organized with project
stakeholders to collect their inputs for the project description and potential impacts. A summary of
the project was prepared and shared with the invitation letter that was sent to all the stakeholders
invited to the workshops (there were about 25 people in each workshop: one in Casamance and

one in Sine-Saloum). The SBIA workshop report was shared with workshop participants on
November 10, 2021 [64] and their feedback collected.

  - Oceanium focal points. The Oceanium representatives in each community act as focal points   and
can receive and disseminate the information through villagers.

  - Routine villager assembly. The project owner will notify local stakeholders through the routine
villager assembly regarding every milestone of the project development, including listing,
registration, issuance, etc.

In addition, all VCS and CCB project documents will be made publicly available on the Verra registry.

**2.3.2** **Dissemination of Summary Project Documents (G3.1)**

Project documentation will be published on the VCS and CCB websites for all stakeholders to obtain the
detailed project information and development progress. Summary information on monitoring results will be
actively disseminated to project stakeholders through channels as described below. Also, the summary of
the project description in the local language (Wolof, French, Serere, or Diola) has been shared among local
communities during the cinema debates [65], the radio podcast transmissions [66], and also in the participatory
workshop held in 2021. The discussions held during cinema debates were held in French, Wolof and Diola,
the radio podcast transmissions are always done in Wolof, Serere, or Diola depending on the radio
localization (Serere for radio stations based in Sine-Saloum and Diola for radio stations based in
Casamance).

The key activities to disseminate information to communities and receive feedback are as follows:

  - Interviews with mayors. In these interviews, the Oceanium team gave the key information about
the project to offer participation in the projects [67] .

  - Radio podcasts (RP), which were retransmitted in the radio stations of the project area [68] . These
broadcasts included general information of the project and were planned to reach all local

communities.

  - Cinema debate (CD) [69] . Each community was invited to participate in the cinema debate to be
informed about the project and listen to their concerns and ideas. To notify the population,
Oceanium listed their assistance in all the villages of the project. They spread the information by
word of mouth to the village leaders, children, and people they met. This is a typical method of
communication. Regarding the inhabitants of the surrounding villages, they traveled by their own
means. Nonetheless, to compensate for their travel, Oceanium provided snacks and drinks to
participants. The cinema debates were carried out by Oceanium facilitators and were structured in

three blocks:

`o` A video of about 30 minutes which explains the situation of the mangroves in Casamance
and Sine-Saloum. The film on the return of mangroves, directed by Nicolas Van Ingen, on
the state of mangrove degradation in the Sine-Saloum and Casamance, and the urgency
of restoring it for local people and the ecosystem.
`o` A PowerPoint presentation that describes the key points of the project, including required
information for G1.1-9 in CCB standards (Project overview and *Project Design and*
*Boundaries)* [70] . This is a free space to listen to actors about key issues they want to discuss,
their concerns, expectations, etc.

Oceanium included the contact details of its local representative in the presentation so that any participant

could make contact.

In total, 25 cinema debates were conducted. Due to the security measures regarding the COVID pandemic,
the sharing sessions brought together on average between 40 and 50 people for about two hours. However,
some flagship localities like Niambalan and Coubalan attracted about a hundred people each. These
projections have raised awareness among 1,200 to 1,500 people regarding the importance of reforestation
and of preserving natural resources. This allowed each of the project actors to share their opinions and
ideas for better sustainability of the project. The communities highlighted that a sustained effort to combat
salinization and its related problems needs to be made in the areas affected by mangrove restoration.

- As a result of the SBIA workshop, the project’s final report with the activities to be implemented and
outputs, outcomes, and impacts expected was shared with the communities. The results of the
workshops were shared by email with the communities in French [71], since this is a language understood
and used by all ethnic groups. Each SBIA workshop participant was asked to spread the content of
the workshop result to the people they were representing for them to have a chance to get the
information required to understand the project activity. In addition, during field visits and activities,
Oceanium will ensure that the people they meet have knowledge of the project and will report back to
the project management on the level of knowledge of the project activities. Depending on the level of

**2.3.3** **Informational Meetings with Stakeholders (G3.1)**

The informational meetings include the ones described in the section above and also particular meetings
with different local associations. The meetings with the mayors were scheduled with the Oceanium team.
The cinema debates were publicized in the radio podcasts.

Each year there is a meeting with the Ministry of Environment to present them the project achievements in
order to collect their recommendations on the project implementation.

Beyond these bilateral meetings, a SBIA workshop was organized in Sine-Saloum (April 27-29 2021) and
Casamance (May 4-6 2021) where representative stakeholders (including community mayors, governors,
representatives of the Senegalese Government, local associations, NGOs, educational and research
institutions, and representatives of other projects) were invited. An invitation letter and a summary of the
project were sent to the stakeholders in order to inform and invite them to participate in the workshop. The
workshop organization team called all the invited stakeholders to confirm their participation in the workshop.

**2.3.4** **Community Costs, Risks, and Benefits (G3.2)**

During the SBIA workshop, project WeForest and Oceanium staff explained the potential costs, risks, and
benefits to relevant communities and stakeholders by using the Theory of Change, and invited them to give
their feedback. These were identified using a participatory and transparent process. [73]

According to the workshop, the community benefits of the project include incomes from selling carbon
credits, environmental (improve the biodiversity, salinity control, aesthetics, etc.), and social (jobs
opportunities during the plantations, economic opportunities, and capacity building from improved activities
in selected value chains such as oyster- and beekeeping). Stakeholders are aware of the design concept
of the project and have shown their willingness to participate in the project.

The map of selected stakeholders is available as supporting documentation [74] .

**2.3.5** **Information to Stakeholders on Validation and Verification Process (G3.3)**

The project stakeholder representatives have been (and will continue to be) informed on the validation and
verification process through the cinema debate, the SBIA workshop, Oceanium staff field mission visits, the
project regionals and national committee, and by formal letter, a call, and email.

Oceanium’s zone coordinators will inform people and collect the evidence available as supporting
documentation (this will consist of a table with the list of people that have been contacted, their number,
and the way they have been contacted to be informed about the auditor field visit).

## CCB & VCS PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

*CCB Version 3, VCS Version 3*

A communication and grievance mechanism [75] has been developed and will be implemented during the
project life cycle. The goals of this mechanism are as follows:

   - Provide effective means to convey information about the project to the relevant stakeholders.

   - Provide clear means for the community to express their concerns to the project proponent.

   - Provide clear and definite procedures for handling complaints.

   - Provide effective procedures to resolve disputes between the community and project proponent if
any problems occur in the preparation and implementation of the project.

The summary of the project will be translated into French and distributed to the primary stakeholders,
primarily those participating in the SBIA workshop.

To ensure that key actors have a good understanding of the grievance mechanism Oceanium´s staff have
organized several meetings at the community level to spread the information to elected officials from the
project’s intervention villages.

One month after these meetings, Oceanium’s project management team will visit 10% of the intervention
villages to interview people and measure their level of awareness of people regarding the project and the
grievance mechanism. In the event that a lack of awareness of the project persists, communication activities
such as cinema debates can be planned in villages with low awareness. In addition, Oceanium’s relays can
also organize specific meetings with the population to reinforce their knowledge.

During all the project communication events in the villages (cinema debates, radio broadcasts), the
presence of a complaints management mechanism specific to the project will be presented.

**2.3.6** **Site Visit Information and Opportunities to Communicate with Auditor (G3.3)**

The local stakeholders have been kept informed regarding the project process, especially when the auditor
would be making the site visit. A week prior to the visit, the project staff informed relevant stakeholders in
advance about the details of the audit process and arranged a half day for the auditor’s interview with
stakeholders so that the stakeholders had sufficient time to communicate with the auditor [76] .

Oceanium and the project proponent will be in charge of the auditor’s logistics (transportation, hotel,
restaurant, meeting localization) to guarantee a good framework of exchange. Several representatives of
the stakeholders from communities are invited to have a conversation with the project proponent and the
auditor regarding the issues of the relevant project. Some of the meetings between the stakeholders and
the auditor are performed in the absence of the project proponent and implementer.

**2.3.7** **Stakeholder Consultations (G3.4)**

Stakeholders, mainly communities, have played a vital role in the design of the project, mainly in the
following:

  - Cinema debates: after the video and presentation, there was an open discussion to listen to and
clarify the participants’ concerns.

  - SBIA workshops: in this three-day workshop, there was a profound discussion with selected
stakeholders, and their inputs were considered in the final project. Around 25 people assisted with
every workshop, with women representing 30%. Results are detailed in Table 10.

  - National Committee on Climate Change (COMNACC): the project idea was presented to the project
stakeholders (project mayors included) during the technical review and approval workshop of the
mangrove restoration project with the communities of Sine-Saloum and Casamance that was
organized in August 2021. After the project presentation by Oceanium and WeForest, COMNACC
validated the project.

  - National and regional steering committees (see Section 2.4).

  - The environmental and social assessment that will identify the project risks and ways to mitigate
them. For this assessment, consultation with project stakeholders will take place to present the
project to them and to capture their concerns and recommendations about it [77] .

  - Agreements with mayors and governmental authorities.

The first step in this process is that the workshop allows us to build the project document together and to identify the issues that you consider most important to include in the project. In addition, the workshop will allow us to better define how the stakeholders will be involved and to better define their roles. The local stakeholders are expected to be involved in two ways: the first through their mobilizations for reforestation activities and the second in the accompaniment of socio- economic activities (for beekeeping and oysters). The fishermen are obviously stakeholders in the project. We will work in synergy with the other programs that intervene in the area: we will be members of the mangrove platform and we will report all our activities to the governor of the region so that he has a global vision of the actions that take place in the region.|

## CCB & VCS PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

*CCB Version 3, VCS Version 3*

Based on these contributions, the main aspects that had to be revised include [78] :

   - Take into account the project stakeholders in the plantation sites’ identification and in the plantation
monitoring.

   - The plantation monitoring will be done with the Directorates of Marine Protected Areas, and Water
and Forests, Hunting, and Soil Conservation.

   - The project stakeholders (socio-economics actors, mayors, village chief representatives, state
agencies, scientists) will be members of regional and national management committees. They will
give advice and identify the project priorities with the project proponent. The National Committee
will also be responsible for the allocation of funds from carbon credits to municipalities.

   - Maintain communication with all the project stakeholders by updating them on the project
implementation (plantations and livelihoods) by using radio podcast broadcasts and cinema

debates.

**2.3.8** **Continued Consultation and Adaptive Management (G3.4)**

Oceanium will be responsible for maintaining communication with the stakeholders. Oceanium has signed
agreements with local radio stations and will continue to use this channel to inform local stakeholders on
the project implementation. In addition, before each plantation campaign, Oceanium will organize cinema
debates in the project communities and will hold meetings with communities’ representatives (mayors).

Stakeholders will also be able to give their opinions and recommendations on the implementation of the
project to the project proponent.

This will be possible through the channels listed below:

- Cinema debate: After the presentation of the project and the associated film, there is systematically a time
for exchange between Oceanium and the communities. It is during these debates that the communities can
transmit their opinions, recommendations, and grievances.

- Steering committee: During the national and regional steering committees, stakeholders, including
mayors, village chiefs, and the administration give their opinions and recommendations on the
implementation of the project. These opinions are recorded in minutes and the project has a maximum of
one year to take the recommendations and opinions into account.

- Radio broadcast: These will be retransmitted via the radio stations of the project area. These broadcasts
included the critical facts of the project and are planned to reach all local communities. After broadcasts,
public feedback will be received and responded to directly by the Oceanium staff in charge of the

transmission.

## CCB & VCS PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

*CCB Version 3, VCS Version 3*

- Village relays: Oceanium has a vast network of village focal points in the project area. These relays are
known to all and their mission is to open up a dialog with the stakeholders and bring up the needs,
recommendations, and opinions of the communities.

- Grievance mechanisms: The complaint management mechanism that will be put in place will be based on
the involvement of the mayors, prefects, and Oceanium. The mayors and Oceanium staff will have at their
disposal a complaints management book where they will record all complaints and grievances received on
the project. Depending on the level of the complaint, several channels of discussion are planned (see
Sections 2.3.12 and 2.3.13).

**2.3.9** **Stakeholder Consultation Channels (G3.5)**

As mentioned, given that Oceanium is a well-known and well-established NGO in the communities, there
are adequate communication channels with all the communities participating in the project and with other
stakeholders (government, local associations, NGOs, research centers, etc.). The radio broadcasts, the
cinema debates, the COMNACC, and the SBIA workshops were the primary channels for local communities
to participate. During these activities, critical issues of interest for the communities were shared, including
the areas to be planted, the jobs generated, the income from carbon credits etc. These issues were
discussed and clarified. The participants were very active and formulated many questions for the facilitators
during the entire process. To implement project activities (site identification, planting, support for socioeconomic activities, awareness-raising, etc.), Oceanium and Eclosio staff are in constant contact with
communities, elected municipal representatives and administrative authorities (reforestation and site
identification).

Several channels of exchange with stakeholders have been set up so that they reach out to the project
proponent (see Section 2.3.8).

**2.3.10 Stakeholder Participation in Decision-Making and Implementation (G3.6)**

Mechanisms for participation and decision-making for all identified stakeholders have been created since
the beginning of the project. At the start of the project, a local stakeholder consultation [79] was made to
identify communities’ needs and expectations regarding the project livelihood component. In addition, local
communities have been consulted directly (cinema debates [80] ) and through the representation of the
mayors, women, and the youth in the SBIA workshops [81] . The project proponent will also pay attention to
include women and the youth in the project governance organizations.

For the 2021 cinema debate that took place, 39% of the participants were women. See the following table:

*Table 11: The cinema debate participants*

|Number of participants|Gender|
|---|---|
|272|Women|

|691|Total|



During the organization of the cinema debates, Oceanium encouraged village chiefs and mayors to have
women and young people participate. Many young people (in the age group 15-35) were present at these
events. Their good understanding of the project will facilitate their participation in reforestation activities.
Moreover, the young people will be ambassadors of the project to their communities for the preservation of
the plantations carried out within the framework of the project in particular, and of the mangroves in general.

**2.3.11 Anti-Discrimination Assurance (G3.7)**

Senegalese law prohibits discrimination on the grounds of race, nation, sex, or religion. The project
proponent and all project participants have established the anti-discrimination rules in the implementation
of the project, including providing equal job opportunities for any qualified workers regardless of their
gender, race, nationality, or religion, no additional requirements for women or minorities, and equal pay for
equal work, etc. Positive discrimination was considered to select the participants for the SBIA workshop for
women to be properly represented. Also, it was a priority that women participated in the plantations to have
a salary.

These considerations will also be included in the training sessions and during the crediting period so that
women and minority groups are represented in the steering committee and other local communities.
Following the existing grievance and redress procedure, anyone could report any prejudice to the project

proponent.

Oceanium and WeForest are mutually committed to the seven social principles which refer to the
international labor standards defined by the International Labour Organization (ILO): (1) prohibition of child

labor, (2) forced labor, non-discrimination, (3) freedom of association and right to collective bargaining, (4)
occupational health and safety, (5) legal working hours, (6) remuneration at or above the minimum wage.

The selection of the people involved in the reforestation activities is entrusted to the authorities of the
different villages involved in the project. The selection criteria are listed below:

  - Area to be reforested. Depending on the area, the number of planters required varies.

  - Availability of propagules. If propagules are in short supply during reforestation, the area manager
will mobilize a small group.

  - Difficulty of reforestation. The nature of the soil on site is variable. The age and physical ability of
those involved in reforestation activities will be taken into account according to the land difficulty.

  - Age. In order to combat child labor, only people over 15 years of age will be able to participate in
the activities as planters, nursery workers, or agents in charge of cleaning the plantations.

  - The origin of the operators. In order to enable communities to generate income through
reforestation, priority will be given to communities living in the project area (reforestation,
transplanting, cleaning).

Once the number of people needed has been identified by the local authorities, they share the list with the
zone chief who ensures that the number of participants identified corresponds to expectations and that at
least 30% of the proposed groups are women’s groups.

Women and men participated in the cinema debates, and focus was made to include women in the SBIA
workshop. In Casamance, out of 25 participants, six were women, and in Sine-Saloum out of the 23

participants, six were women. The project will continue to involve women in the project decision and would
like to reach 30% minimum participation of women in its activities.

**2.3.12 Feedback and Grievance Redress Procedure (G3.8)**

**COMPLAINT MANAGEMENT PROCESS FOR THE MANCO PROJECT.**

**Definition of common concepts**

� Complaint Management Mechanism (CMM):

The Complaint Management Mechanism is the practice of receiving, addressing and responding to
concerns about mangrove plantations in a systematized manner.

� Complaint

A complaint is an expression of dissatisfaction with the implementation of project activities (planting,
communication, stakeholder inclusion, other). These complaints may refer to actions or inactions by staff,
volunteers or direct beneficiaries of the project that directly or indirectly cause anxiety or negative effects

to anyone.
#### 90

CCB v3.0, VCS v3.3


-----

## CCB & VCS PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

*CCB Version 3, VCS Version 3*

Complaints about the implementation of the Project may involve sensitive issues that should be handled
confidentially, respecting the wishes of the potential complainants.

� Stakeholders

A Stakeholder is an individual or group that has an interest and/or impact in the project's decisions or
activities; that is, whose interests may be positively or negatively affected as a result of the execution (or
non-execution) of the project's decisions or activities.

� Complainant

Any individual, group of individuals, or structure affected directly or indirectly by the project activities as well
as those who may have an interest in the project or the ability to influence its outcomes.

**Objectives**

� Establish a system for receiving, recording, and addressing complaints and concerns in a timely
manner with special attention to vulnerable groups;
� To provide an efficient, transparent, timely, fair, and non-discriminatory system that would allow
aggrieved persons to complain and avoid litigation;
� Promote the social and amicable resolution of complaints;
� Ensure the sustainability of the project's interventions and its ownership by the stakeholders;
� Provide clarification in response to requests for information.

**Complaint Management Procedure**

1. Access to information

During the course of project activities, stakeholders will be periodically informed of the ongoing complaint
management mechanism. For example, stakeholders will be informed of the existence of a complaint
management mechanism at the following events:

  - reforestation operations

  - plantation cleaning

  - cinema-debate

  - community radio programs

  - project meetings (national and regional steering committees, project presentation to mayors and
authorities)

During these events, stakeholders will be informed of the opportunity to communicate their complaints and
grievances to the project manager.

2. Receipt and registration of the complaint

**Informal handling of a complaint:**
#### 91

CCB v3.0, VCS v3.3


-----

## CCB & VCS PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

*CCB Version 3, VCS Version 3*

When an individual or group of individuals wish to refer a complaint, they should first approach the
Oceanium relays or Oceanium staff who live in or near the village. The initial objective is to seek a resolution
informally.

**Formal complaint:**

If it is not possible to resolve a complaint informally, or if the stakeholder does not feel it is appropriate to
do so, they should raise the issue formally in writing to Oceanium through (1) the mayors, (2) local authority
(like prefet) f, or (3) Oceanium project manager. The written complaint can be submitted anonymously, or
by a third party on behalf of the grievant. The written complaint should contain details of the nature of the
complaint and how they feel it could be resolved. The written complaint will be sent to Oceanium's
institutional officer who sends the complaint to the zone chief who must write a report with his analysis of
the situation. Then this report is sent to the project manager who proposes a solution. The booklet will
contain a table according to the model below:

*Table 12: Formal complaint table*









|Date of complaint|Name of complaina nt|Complain ant's phone number|Grounds for complaint|Complain ant's expectatio ns of the complaint|Signature of complaina nt|date of return of the complaint|signature (when the complaint is returned)|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|||||||||
|||||||||
|||||||||
|||||||||
|||||||||
|||||||||


The Zone Manager will call the complainant to a meeting to discuss the complaint with him/her. This will
normally take place within 10 working days of receiving the complaint in writing. Complainants should be
allowed to explain their complaint and how they think it might be resolved. The complainant may be
accompanied by a third party if requested. After the meeting, the Area Manager (within 5 business days)
will inform the complainant in writing of what action, if any, he/she has decided to take, along with a full
explanation of how the decision was made. The complainant shall be informed that he/she may appeal (and
to whom the appeal should be made) if he/she feels that the complaint has not been satisfactorily resolved.

**Appeal**
#### 92

CCB v3.0, VCS v3.3


-----

## CCB & VCS PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

*CCB Version 3, VCS Version 3*

If the complainant wishes to appeal, he or she must notify the reasons for this appeal. This should be done
within 5 business days of the written communication of the complaint hearing decision. Within 10 business
days of receiving the appeal, an appeal meeting will be held. The appeal will be handled by Oceanium head
office staff. If requested by the complainant, a third party mediator can be engaged to hear the appeal.

After the meeting, Oceanium (or the third party mediator) will notify the complainant in writing of the outcome
of the appeal, no later than 10 business days after the appeal hearing. This decision is final.

3. Consideration of the complaint and return to the complainant

Whatever the method of handling the complaint (amicable, negotiation or justice), the person who received
the complaint will have to give feedback to the complainant on the handling of his complaint. This feedback
will be made within 15 working days. The feedback may be given by telephone or verbally and the date of
the feedback on the complaint will be mentioned in the notebooks provided for this purpose and the
escalation mechanism in the absence of an amicable resolution will be systematically reminded to the
complainant. The table for receiving feedback on complaints is presented below:

The complaint form is available in Annex 3.

**2.3.13 Accessibility of the Grievance Redress Procedure (G3.8)**

The project will rely on elected municipal officials to inform communities about the grievance redress
procedures. The elected municipal officials are drawn from all the villages in the project’s communes and
are responsible for sharing the information with their constituents. In order to ensure that the communities
have a good knowledge of the project’s grievance redress procedure, Oceanium and WeForest will
organize meetings to present the project to all the municipal councils so that they can present the project
and the grievance redress procedure to the populations. Graphical copies of the procedure will also be

distributed in the communes.

Oceanium and WeForest will be responsible for ensuring that the elected representatives from the project
villages share the information with the inhabitants. During Oceanium’s field missions their teams will get
closer to the elected officials in order to assess their level of knowledge and to provide them with additional
information so that the populations can have the right information about the complaint management system.

During the project, grievances collected during the year will be presented to the members from the national
and regional committees. The decision made for each grievance will also be shared during those committee
meetings.
#### 94

## CCB & VCS PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

*CCB Version 3, VCS Version 3*

At the village level, records will be kept by the village chief on any complaint raised concerning the project.
These records will be accessible to anyone who would like to see them. Residents will have the ability to
reach out to the mayor, Oceanium staff, or the village chief if they have any complaint to address.

**2.3.14 Worker Training (G3.9)**

Different training events took place during the restoration campaign activities:

      - Nursery training: All the 19 people recruited for the A *vicennia spp.* nurseries have been
trained on seed collection, nursery management, pests, transportation, and replanting.

      - Banana leaf sheaths: In 2021, 150 women were hired and trained to produce banana leaf
sheaths for use in the *Avicennia* spp. nurseries. [82] This has the objective of making the
nursery operations more environmentally sustainable. However, this activity was
discontinued due to limited availability of banana leaves to meet the demands of the
project.

      - Storage training: One of the risks identified in the *Rhizophora* plantation is the quality of
propagules. Oceanium staff are trained at the beginning of each plantation campaign to
manage the storage of propagules. In addition, at the beginning of plantation, planters are
trained on addressing the shortage of propagules and the identification of good propagules
to be used for the plantation [83] .

      - Plantation training: Oceanium staff are training the planters for *Rhizophora spp.* and
*Avicennia spp.* plantation (density, method of planting, etc.). A reforestation day can gather
between 50 and 500 people (minimum 50 people per reforestation site) [84] . In the 2021
campaign for *Avicennia spp.*, the operations mobilized 2,189 men and women together.

      - Monitoring training: The plantation monitoring methodology includes the density control,
the mortality and survival calculations, environmental and physical characteristics, and the
pests / disease identification attacks. Oceanium staff is trained to collect data and they are
supervised by the Oceanium project manager. The Oceanium monitoring and evaluation
officer is responsible for the data analysis and for the field training for Oceanium field staff.
In addition, Oceanium field staff have been trained on KoBo Collect [85] to allow digitization
of the plantation monitoring process. This training occurred in August 2021 and was

82 The January-March Oceanium narrative report is available as supporting documentation, and includes
the following: A two-day training was organized in the villages of Niambalang, Youtou, Kaguite, and Siganar
to strengthen the capacities of 140 trainers, the majority of whom are women who will then be in charge of
multiplying the training to 250 other people.

provided to the project manager, the project M&E officer, and the Casamance coordinator.
In December 2021, the Oceanium project M&E officer trained the Sine-Saloum Oceanium
staff on the use of KoBo Collect. For Casamance, the staff was trained by the Oceanium

field coordinator on the use of KoBo Collect.

      - First aid training: In April 2021, all the Oceanium permanent staff were trained in first aid
by the Red Cross [86] . In May 2024, Oceanium will be trained again on first aid by the Red

Cross.

      - HSSE management plan training [87] : In July 2021, 23 Oceanium staff were trained [88] on the
Oceanium heath, security, and environmental management plan. Each semester,
Oceanium staff produces a document with all the incidents identified and the mitigation
measures to avoid repeating those incidents. In May 2024, Oceanium staff will also be
trained again to ensure that this HSSE management plan is well known by Oceanium staff.

**2.3.15 Community Employment Opportunities (G3.10)**

There are four main groups of employment opportunities generated by the project:

  - Those related directly to reforestation activities, including propagules collection, nursery, and
plantation activities.

  - Direct activities derived from the improvements in fishing, oystering, non-timber product collection
and selling, and beekeeping.

  - Indirect activities due to the improvements in the mangrove ecosystem; local communities will have
more fishing opportunities, oyster collection, beekeeping, and field cultivation thanks to the

reduction in salinization.

  - Opportunities derived from the project monitoring.

For the plantation activities, the project is mobilizing a large number of community members who are paid
for those activities (e.g.: 2 189 people were engaged in the 2021 plantation campaign). A protocol that
guarantees equal opportunities [89] was elaborated to avoid any discrimination and prevent any conflict
among communities.

**2.3.16 Relevant Laws and Regulations Related to Workers’ Rights (G3.11)**

The legal framework is the Senegalese Labour Code (Law No. 97-17 of December 1, 1997), in particular
Title XI, which deals with health and safety at work, and the national interprofessional collective agreement

of December 30, 2019.

Several texts on the subject have been adopted by the Senegalese State:

      - Decree No. 2006-1249 of 15 November 2006 establishing minimum safety and health
requirements for temporary or mobile construction sites.

      - Decree No. 2006-1252 of 15 November 2006 laying down minimum requirements for the
prevention of certain physical environmental factors.

      - Decree no. 2006-1254 of 15 November 2006 on the manual handling of loads.

      - Decree No. 2006-1256 of 15 November 2006 setting out the obligations of employers in
terms of safety at work

and improvement of the environment.

Senegal is one of the 187 member states of the ILO, the only tripartite organization of the United Nations
that designs international standards, policies, and programs to promote decent work.

**2.3.17 Occupational Safety Assessment (G3.12)**

Given the scale of the project, the number of people from the communities (5,900 planters), and the risks
associated with plantation operations, Oceanium needed to strengthen its health, safety, and environmental
management plan. A consultant was recruited [90] to help identify the risks linked to plantation operations and
the Oceanium teams in charge of plantations were trained in this management plan. The HSSE plan aims
to assist Oceanium’s approach to improve the safety of staff and people involved in reforestation. The
HSSE plan provides general guidance on precautions and procedures applicable to most situations
encountered. All staff were also trained in first aid. In addition, all dugout canoes carrying staff have first
aid kits and freshwater rations for the planters.

During tree planting, the workers face the risk of injuries from the heavy weights they have to carry and the
exposure of planters to the sun. The risks posed by the plantation are assessed to be of a similar magnitude
as those of their usual activities as fishermen, oyster collectors, or beekeepers.

A health and safety plan has been produced to identify, monitor, and manage the negative impact of these
risks. The project HSSE management plan identifies the principal risks of the project for the workers and

proposes measures to mitigate them. Any new risks identified will be mitigated and the HSSE management
plan will be improved over time. The Project HSSE management plan can be provided on request.

The community participation rate shows a genuine enthusiasm from the community to reforest the
mangrove in their locality. A reforestation day can gather between 50 and 500 people (minimum 50 people
per reforestation site). From July to September 2020, about 270 reforestation operations were carried out,
involving approximately 15,000 people.

The risks and the mitigation measures to implement in the project can be reviewed in the supporting

documentation.

To reduce risks associated with planting activities, Oceanium has put in place the measures listed below:

  - Provision of first aid kits and life jackets in the canoes.

  - Production and distribution of a sheet containing the contacts of the health centers and hospitals
in the reforestation areas to the teams in charge of reforestation.

  - Exchange with the assistance branch in Ziguinchor to organize first aid training in 2021.

The first version of the HSSE action plan was finalized in November 2020. In December 2020, the plan [91]
was presented to the stakeholders (planters, boat drivers, others) to validate its content. The document [92]
has been submitted for the approval of the Oceanium president.

For each campaign, the Oceanium teams fill in an incident log. The various incidents listed are analyzed [93]
and the mitigating measures taken are evaluated. The incident logs are available at the various Oceanium

field bases.

1) Ensure an up-to-date, fluid, and consistent connection between the field team (Senegal) and the main
managers of the operation (Belgium).

2) Ensure correct implementation of all the proposed activities, together with the implementing partner
(Oceanium).

3) Be directly aware of any incidents that may occur during the implementation of the project.

4) Have direct connection with different stakeholders, both with those who are in charge of the decisionmaking process (steering committees), and with those who are in charge of the implementation of the
activities and the Monitoring Plan (the communities, mayors, and local structures and organizations).

5) Support in development and implementation of the monitoring plan, and reporting of the resulting

information.

The project proponent will participate both in decision-making and in the implementation of activities and
the Monitoring Plan, together with the actors and structures defined below:

**Project implementation partner:** The project implementation partner is Oceanium. Oceanium is a local
organization with a very experienced team, which has participated in other environmental and social
projects, including mangrove reforestation. Oceanium is responsible for engaging stakeholders and
implementing the activities in the field.

**Support and consultation partner:** Agresta, a consultancy firm with expertise in forestry, is supporting
Oceanium in the development of the project. Agresta, additionally, was responsible for the writing of the
initial draft documents for auditing.

**National Steering Committee:** As indicated in the tripartite agreement between the Ministry of
Environment and Sustainable Development of Senegal, Oceanium and WeForest, a National Project
Steering Committee will be set up to cover all carbon projects in the country, made up of experts in the
AFOLU sector. The Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development will be responsible for the
establishment of this committee, and will define its composition, functions, and operation. The National
Steering Committee will ensure compliance with the contractual relationship between the participating
municipalities and Oceanium, and revenue share of 10% of the certified carbon credits generated by the
project, according to agreement with the different municipalities and communities, in collaboration with the
regional steering committees. The first National Steering Committee meeting will take place before the first

verification.

Among the main functions of the National Steering Committee are: 1) to be informed of the progress of the
project; 2) to provide support to stakeholders in implementation of the project and ensuring adequate
participation of all organizations involved; 3) align and coordinate the information received from the regional
steering committees. The National Steering Committee will meet in person once a year.

## CCB & VCS PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

*CCB Version 3, VCS Version 3*

**Regional steering committees:** Two regional steering committees will be set up, one for Sine-Saloum and
the other for Casamance. These committees will have the function of improving the engagement of the
actors at the regional level, trying a correct representation of all interests. They will also meet once a year.

These committees are expected to be the meeting place for all those interested in the project. In these
committees all voices and opinions will be heard, which will be shared with WeForest and the National
Steering Committee, to establish implementation priorities.

**Communities:** The project has signed agreements with 17 communities or municipalities. According to the
tripartite agreement between the Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development, all rights to use
the carbon credits will be transferred to Oceanium and then to WeForest. The design of the benefit-sharing
plan is dictated by the Tripartite Agreement signed with the Senegalese Government. Under this
agreement, WeForest will retain 90% of these credits that will be mainly transferred to the investors who
pre-funded the project activities, and the remaining 10% will be channeled to the communities for
community development actions. The commercialization of 10% of the carbon credits will be managed
based on direction of the National Steering Committee.

**Mayors and local governments:** The mayor is the representative of the State and the inhabitants living in
the commune. In this capacity, he is responsible, under the authority of the Prefect, for:

  - the publication and execution of laws, regulations, and decisions of the executive;

  - the execution of general security measures;

  - the special functions attributed to him by the laws and regulations.

The mayor is the representative of the commune. As such, he is responsible, under the control of the
Municipal Council, for administering the commune, preparing, and executing the deliberations of the
Municipal Council.

The Municipal Council, composed of councilors elected for five years by direct universal suffrage in
accordance with the Electoral Code, is the deliberative body of the municipality. The election of the mayor
and his deputies takes place by secret ballot and by an absolute majority. It is the inhabitants of the
communes (composed by villagers) that elected their mayor. According to Article 29 of Law No. 96-07 of
March 22, 1996 transferring powers to the regions, communes, and rural communities [94], the State of
Senegal has transferred to the communes (i) the creation of woods and protected areas, (ii) reforestation
operations, and the creation of communal woods.

**Local structures and organizations:** Oceanium has proven experience in planting mangroves with local
communities and has created a relationship of trust and partnership with various grassroots community
organizations in the village, at municipal, departmental, and regional levels. In addition, the project
collaborates with youth, sports, and cultural associations. Each structure will reforest its own community,

with the support of the project technicians. Payment is made per reforested area and the amounts are paid
to the association or the village structure which will take care of the distribution according to the internal
policy of its organization. To prevent elite capture, the amount of the payment is shared in front of all
community members involved in planting and Oceanium relays express their availability in case of any
payment distribution issue. Since 2020, only one case of inequitable distribution has been raised, and this
was resolved by the project team.

Finally, these structures will also be involved in monitoring the results, also with technical support from the
project.

## CCB & VCS PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

*CCB Version 3, VCS Version 3*

WeForest [95] is implementing reforestation and afforestation projects in multiple countries around the world.
Oceanium [96] was established in Senegal in 1984 and has participated in various mangrove reforestation
projects in the same areas as this project. Agresta [97] has participated in mangrove reforestation, and CCB
and VCS standards projects. Eclosio, which is implementing the socio-economic component of the project,
has solid experience in supporting the integration of producers into the market system.

For more information about the project team, see Sections 2.1.3 and 2.1.4.

**2.4.4** **Project Management Partnerships/Team Development (G4.2)**

All experience needs are covered by the main project partners (WeForest and Oceanium) or by external
partners (Agresta S. Coop, Eclosio). In this way, the experience on plantations is widely covered by
Oceanium, which has been managing large mangrove reforestation projects for around 15 years, and has
dealt with local communities since its creation in 1984. Agresta S. Coop. has provided assistance to PD
developers for more than 10 years. Eclosio, formerly Gembloux Development Aid, was set up in 1986 on
the initiative of the Gembloux University Faculty of Agronomic Sciences. It has carried out numerous
projects to promote food sovereignty for local populations.

The recommendations of the market study [98] led WeForest to recruit an operator to implement the project’s
livelihood activities. As recommended by the study, the choice of seeking collaboration with Eclosio [99] was
justified by the need to have a partner with proven experience in supporting small producers and
entrepreneurs in the project area. Eclosio supports, with the help of its local partners, vulnerable families
and their organizations in order to:

  - develop income-generating agro-ecological activities that are not dependent on external factors
and that respect the environment;

  - benefit from a decent income, particularly through the processing and marketing of their production;

  - benefit from a healthy and balanced diet, with particular emphasis on the role of women as
guarantors of the nutritional health of their families;

  - support local dynamics and territorial development for and by the communities;

  - professionalize themselves through quality training and support in finding sustainable employment;

  - defend their interests by lobbying the public authorities.

## CCB & VCS PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

*CCB Version 3, VCS Version 3*

Following the terms of reference [100] proposed by WeForest, Eclosio has elaborated a detailed proposal for
a project covering an initial two-year pilot phase. Its technical and financial offer is attached to this

document.

Finally, the project has the support of the Ministry of the Environment and Sustainable Development,
certified through the signed tripartite agreement. The Ministry has among its tasks, managing the protected
areas (Sine-Saloum Biosphere Reserve and Marine Protected Area – MPA – Niamone Kalounayes). All
plantation plots in Sine-Saloum belong to the Biosphere Reserve and 51.7% of the plantation plots in
Casamance belong to the MPA. For this reason, the project will be assisted by the Ministry and the
professionals in charge of the protected areas to provide the best technical support and management. Both
parties seek to achieve a common objective: “restore degraded wetlands and to improve soil and
environmental conditions, restoring ecological services and enhancing biodiversity.”

**2.4.5** **Financial Health of Implementing Organization(s) (G4.3)**

This information is described in the risk report.

**2.4.6** **Avoidance of Corruption and Other Unethical Behavior (G4.3)**

In the contract signed between Oceanium and WeForest, Annex 5 mentions that each Party agrees and
warrants that it and its Affiliates, and their respective directors, officers, employees, and personnel, have
not made, offered, or authorized, and will not make, offer, or authorize, in respect of the matters covered
by this Agreement, any payment, gift, promise, or other advantage or thing of value, whether directly or
through any other person or entity, to or for the use or benefit of any public official (such as any person
exercising a legislative, administrative, or judicial function, including any person employed by or acting on
behalf of a public body, public enterprise, or public international organization) or any official of a political
party or candidate for public office, or any member of the official’s or candidate’s immediate family, including
any payment, gift, promise, advantage, or thing of value intended to influence or reward any discretionary
act or decision of that person or organization, or to obtain an improper or inappropriate advantage, in
violation of that party’s internal policies.

In the tripartite agreement between Oceanium, WeForest, and the Ministry of Environment and Sustainable
Development, article 12 deals with the anti-corruption policy. It is written that the parties undertake to
comply with all laws and regulations in terms of ethics, transparency, the fight against corruption, fraud, and
money laundering. The parties also undertake to implement the necessary measures adapted to avoid any
violation of the aforementioned measures, in particular the anti-corruption legislation (Law No. 2015-16 of
July 6, 2015).

WeForest has a Code of Conduct for professional ethics that all staff members and consultants are

expected to sign and adhere to.

**2.4.7** **Commercially Sensitive Information (Rules 3.5.13 – 3.5.14)**

No sensitive information has been generated nor excluded from the public version of the project.
##### **2.5 Legal Status and Property Rights **

**2.5.1** **Statutory and Customary Property Rights (G5.1)**

The ownership and access or use of resources belong to different entities. The project is implemented in
areas of national public domain and the communities have GHG removal rights, which have been
transferred to Oceanium by contractual agreement. Oceanium, in turn, transfers them to WeForest, also by
contractual agreement. Rights to use 10% of the carbon credits will be dedicated to communities that will
identify in which type of project they would like to invest the revenue from credit sale. This process will be
guided by the National Steering Committee, and further information can be found in Section 2.4.1.

Although the project land belongs to the public domain, the communities have the rights of use and access
to resources such as fishing, wood for firewood, or the collection of oysters and other mollusks. In this
sense, the signing of a tripartite agreement between the Ministry of Environment and Sustainable
Development, WeForest, and Oceanium, further ensures the complete availability of land and resources.
Furthermore, 17 agreements have been signed with the municipalities and communities, in which they
commit to the execution of the project in conjunction with Oceanium and WeForest. All these agreements

ensure that:

1) Land and resources are fully available to implement project activities.

2) The areas in the plantation plots will be used for the purpose of the project (the regeneration of the
mangrove), and not for other uses unrelated to the project activities.

**2.5.2** **Recognition of Property Rights (G5.1)**

The lands chosen as the project area belong to the lands of public domain. Officially, according to Law No.
64-46 of 1964, the tripartite agreement signed between the government, WeForest, and Oceanium takes
into account its execution in areas of public domain, with permission of exploitation and sustainable use by
the communities, according to the agreement and in the forestry code of Senegal.

Property rights to land and resources are recognized and respected in this project. In this sense, and to
ensure this, 17 agreements have been signed with each of the municipalities where the plantation plots are
located, and one (1) tripartite agreement, between the Ministry of Environment and Sustainable
Development, WeForest, and Oceanium, has been signed to ensure accessibility to both lands and the
resources they host.

The carbon rights to the project proponent have been confirmed by the authorization agreement signed in
the tripartite agreement on October 8, 2021.

**2.5.3** **Free, Prior and Informed Consent (G5.2)**

The official start date of the project was July 2020. By that date, Oceanium and WeForest had already
reached agreements with the 17 municipalities where the plantation plots are located. The agreements
were signed between Oceanium and each of the communities involved. These agreements, added to the
tripartite agreement between the national government, WeForest, and Oceanium, ensure the legality of all

actions.

Apart from the meetings to present the project to the mayors and public institutions, cinema debates were
organized in the 17 communes of the project. These cinema debates were an opportunity to present the
project to each community and raise awareness about the degradation of mangroves. Following the
screening of the film and the presentation of the project, the communities expressed their willingness to
participate in the project and provided their consent for the project implementation.

The process of signing the agreements was informed and consented to with the communities. In this sense,
several communication channels have been implemented with the residents of the towns that will participate
in the project (see the communication plan, included in supporting documentation, for more information).

Finally, this project includes the provision of allocating 10% of the sales of the carbon credits generated to
the communities, so that they can implement social and local development projects.

All this is included in the agreements, so that, as prioritized in the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD),
signed in 1992 by 196 countries, including Senegal, there is an adequate distribution of the benefits
generated by the use of biodiversity.

**2.5.4** **Property Rights Protection (G5.3)**

The project area belongs to the state [101] . Communities have the rights of use of natural resources [   102,] and
agreements have been signed with all parties involved which give their consent and approval, and show
their participation and convenience with the project. Therefore, the project ensures that project activities
will not lead to involuntary removal or relocation of property rights holders from their lands or territories, and
does not force rights holders to relocate activities important to their culture or livelihood.

101 See Law 64-46 (June 17, 1964), page 3 as supporting documentation. In this law, it is written that 95%
of the lands belong to the state. In addition, the plantation areas have been selected to belong to the Public
Domain, in a joint consultation between the communities, Oceanium, and the Government of Senegal.

**2.5.5** **Illegal Activity Identification (G5.4)**

The parties involved in the project do not carry out illegal activities in the project area or in nearby mangrove
areas. However, possible incursions by foreign people who extract the resources (such as for hunting and
fishing) have been reported, with the possibility of degrading the mangrove.

As currently 100% of the project area in Sine-Saloum and more than 50% of the project area in Casamance
belong to protected areas, the project will work together with the government and the communities involved
to obtain evidence and protect the areas against possible illegal activities or non-consensual use or
exploitation.

**2.5.6** **Ongoing Disputes (G5.5)**

Not applicable. There was no current dispute at the beginning of the project in the project area.

**2.5.7** **National and Local Laws (G5.6)**

The major policy instruments that structure the management and conservation of natural resources in
Senegal are the Plan Senegal Emergent (PSE Vert) and sectoral policies (environmental, forestry,
sustainable development, decentralization, wetlands, and biodiversity). These policy instruments place
particular emphasis on:

- deepening knowledge of natural resources;

- development of natural resources;

- the fight against the degradation of the environment and natural resources;

- meeting the needs of communities in terms of biological diversity resources;

- strengthening the institutional and technical capacities of actors in the implementation of actions for the
conservation of the environment and natural resources;

- promotion of livelihoods;

- the resilience of vulnerable groups.

Several legal instruments govern the management of natural resources. The main instruments are:

  - Law No. 2001-01 of January 15, 2001 on the Environment Code

  - Law No. 2018-25 of November 2, 2018 on the Forest Code

  - Law No. 86-04 of January 24, 1986 on the Code of Hunting and Wildlife Protection

  - Law No. 2015-18 of July 13, 2015 on the Maritime Fisheries Code, their implementing texts

  - Law of National Dominion 64-46

  - the relevant conventions ratified by Senegal. The main ones, in relation to this project, are:

`o` the convention on wetlands of international importance (Ramsar, 1971) [103] ;
`o` the International Convention on Endangered Flora and Fauna Species (CITES);
`o` the RIO Convention on Biodiversity (1992);
`o` the United Nations framework convention on climate change (1992);
`o` the convention to combat desertification (1994);
`o` the convention on the protection of the world heritage;
`o` the United Nations convention on the rights of the sea (Montego Bay, 1982) [104] .

These documents describe how to carry out the conservation and sustainable use of environmental
resources and biodiversity in Senegal. Among the main rules are the following:

  - “Forest management aims at the rational exploitation of forest resources”

  - “For forests managed by a municipality or a rural community, the exploitation of forest products is
subject to the prior authorization of the mayor or the president of the rural council”.

The objectives of the project and its associated activities are fully aligned with local, national, and
international law as they seek:

1. to mitigate climate change by the removal of GHG through biomass growth;
2. to improve the well-being of local communities by creating job opportunities, increasing available

natural resources, improving livelihoods, and enhancing the capacities of resident women and men;
3. to restore degraded wetlands and to improve soil and environmental conditions, restoring

ecological services and enhancing biodiversity, providing monitoring that ensures a good state of

conservation.

Through the Monitoring Plan (see Section 5.4), indicators have been chosen that will ensure compliance
with these objectives and that are aligned with the law.

The government of Senegal has signed an agreement with the project and is alert about its execution. The
project will communicate the progress and results to the government through the steering committees.
Likewise, through these committees, the government can participate in possible changes in activities in
case not all laws are being complied with. The committees meet in person once a year.

According to the tripartite agreement signed between the government, WeForest, and Oceanium, The
Environment Directorate of the Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development (Government of
Senegal) will ensure compliance with the implementation of this framework agreement on behalf of the

103 Which entered into force in Senegal on 11/11/1977 with the aim of preventing wetlands of international
importance as habitat for waterfowl from being subject to destructive interventions.

government of Senegal and will ensure the environmental assessment of the project and the
implementation of the related environmental management framework. It will also support, in collaboration
with the National Committee on Climate Change, all verification and certification operations, and the
avoidance of double counting of emission credits, within the limits of available resources.

**2.5.8** **Approvals (G5.7)**

The project has been approved by parties. In this way, there are the following signed agreements:

1. Tripartite agreement between the government of Senegal, WeForest, and Oceanium
2. Agreements with 17 communities

For more information on these agreements, please review the supporting documentation.

**2.5.9** **Project Ownership (G5.8)**

In Senegal there are three types of land tenure:

- the lands of the national domain governed by Law No. 64-46 of June 17, 1964. The national domain
constitutes a vast space which included, at the time of its constitution in 1964, more than 95% of the
Senegalese territory. National domain is subdivided into public domain (ex: roads, seas, natural resources
like oil and gas) and private domain (state building, hospitals, schools etc.).

- private land, subject to land titles belonging to individuals and constituted on the basis of the decree of
July 26, 1932, now replaced by Law No. 2011-07 of March 30, 2011 on the land ownership regime. Private
land represents 5% of the Senegalese territory.

The tripartite agreement signed between the government, WeForest, and Oceanium takes into account its
execution in areas of public domain, with permission of exploitation and sustainable use by the
communities, according to the agreement and in the forestry code of Senegal. Below are some key
provisions of the tripartite agreement:

  - The project is being implemented on national domain in Senegal. The land will therefore remain
the property of the State.

  - In accordance with the signed tripartite agreement: 10% of the carbon credits that will be generated
during the thirty (30) years following the start of the project will be retroceded to the communes
covered by the project; and 90% of the carbon credits that will be generated during the thirty (30)
years following the start of the project will be retroceded to WeForest to cover operational costs.

  - The management of the project and the achievement of the results is the responsibility of WeForest
and Oceanium according to the means at their disposal.

**2.5.10 Management of Double Counting Risk (G5.9)**

This project will not seek to generate and has not received any form of environmental or social credit.

The tripartite agreement signed between the Government, Oceanium, and WeForest states clearly that
none of the contributions will be double counted. The Government states that it will proceed with
corresponding adjustments and won’t use the project for its NDC:

The article 6 from the Convention signed with government defines the conditions regarding the NDC:

"This agreement falls within the framework of the voluntary carbon market system and the Verified Carbon
Standard of the VERRA association. This implies that the State of Senegal:

- Authorizes WeForest to issue these credits in the VERRA carbon standard registry, directly to an account
held by WeForest.

- Authorizes WeForest and any buyer of these credits to transfer them internationally.

- Authorizes the use of these cr e di t s fo r p u rposes other than the fulfillment of the NDC.

- Will make the necessary accounting adjustments to prevent any risk of double counting”

**2.5.11 Emissions Trading Programs and Other Binding Limits**

The project will not seek to generate or to receive any form of environmental credits and the GHG emission
removals generated by the project will not be used for compliance under such programs or mechanisms.

**2.5.12 Other Forms of Environmental Credit**

The project has not sought or received another form of GHG-related environmental credit, including
renewable energy certificates.

**2.5.13 Participation under Other GHG Programs**

The project has not been registered, and is not seeking registration under any other GHG programs.

**2.5.14 Projects Rejected by Other GHG Programs**

The project has not been rejected by any other GHG programs.

**2.5.15 Double Counting (G5.9)**

The credits generated from the project will be sold as offsets on the VCS registry, and the series number
of the issued credits will be tracked to avoid any potential double counting. The Government signed a

contract that stipulates that corresponding adjustments will be done according to the carbon credits volume

issued.
##### **3 CLIMATE ** **3.1 Application of Methodology **

**3.1.1** **Title and Reference of Methodology**

The methodology used in this VCS ARR and WRC (RWE) project is the CDM Afforestation and
Reforestation Large-scale Methodology: AR AM0014 “Afforestation and reforestation of degraded
mangrove habitats, version 3.0.” The project adheres to the ARR and WRC requirements of the VCS.

The project will shift to the VM0033 Methodology for Tidal Wetland and Seagrass Restoration at first

verification.

The following methodological tools, to which the selected methodology refers, are used:

         - Combined tool to identify the baseline scenario and demonstrate additionality in A/R CDM
project activities, v1.0.

         - Estimation of non-CO 2 GHG emissions resulting from burning of biomass attributable to an
A/R CDM project activity, v4.0.0.

         - Estimation of carbon stocks and change in carbon stocks of trees and shrubs in A/R CDM
project activities, v4.2 (AR TOOL14).

         - Estimation of carbon stocks and change in carbon stocks in dead wood and litter in A/R
CDM project activities, v3.1 (AR TOOL12).

         - Estimation of the increase in GHG emissions attributable to displacement of pre-project
agricultural activities in A/R CDM project activity, v2.0.

Other A/R CDM tools used are:

         - Demonstrating appropriateness of allometric equations for estimation of aboveground tree
biomass in A/R CDM project activities, v1.0.1.

         - Calculation of the number of sample plots for measurements within A/R CDM project

activities, v2.1.0.

Default values provided by the VCS Tidal Wetland and Seagrass Restoration methodology (VM0033) are

also used.

**3.1.2** **Applicability of Methodology**

The project meets the applicability conditions of the methodology:
#### 111

CCB v3.0, VCS v3.3


-----

## CCB & VCS PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

*CCB Version 3, VCS Version 3*

      - Applicability Conditions of AR-AM0014
a) The land subject to the project activity is degraded mangrove habitat.

According to the literature consulted [105], mangroves have been reduced since the 1980s in the project area
due to multiple degradation factors, such as drought in the 1970s and 1980s, infrastructure construction
(roads or hydro-agriculture), and other anthropogenic activities, including deforestation for firewood and
construction timber, mangrove clearing for fish smoking, unsustainable oyster collection, and some other
fishing practices.

b) More than 90% of the project area is planted with mangrove species. If more than 10% of the

project area is planted with non-mangrove species, then the project activity does not lead to
alteration of hydrology of the project area and hydrology of connected up-gradient and downgradient wetland area.

The first project activity instance conducts planting between 2020 and 2022. One hundred percent of the
project area is planted with mangrove species. The proposed species distribution is the following:

      - 75% *Rhizophora mangle*

      - 15% *Rhizophora racemosa*

      - 10% *Avicennia germinans*

No flooding, excavation, drainage, ditch blocking, or any other direct activity involving alteration of hydrology
is planned. The only project activity is the planting of seedlings.

c) Soil disturbance attributable to the project activity does not cover more than 10% of area.

Planting activities will be conducted manually by the local community in the project area and there will be
no need to dig holes. Thus, soil treatment is not required, and no soil disturbance caused by the project
activity is expected.

Applicability conditions of the tools contained in the methodology and applied by the project activity must
also be complied with.

      - Applicability conditions of the tools used

Combined tool to identify the baseline scenario and demonstrate additionality in A/R CDM project activities,
v1.0 is applicable under the following conditions:

## CCB & VCS PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

*CCB Version 3, VCS Version 3*

This tool has no internal applicability conditions.

Therefore, AR-AM0014, v3.0 is applicable for the proposed project.

As a combined ARR+RWE project, the project meets all the WRC requirements in v4.4 of the VCS
Standard. As a project located in the coastal zone, the impact of expected sea level rise (SLR) on the
planted boundary and carbon stocks, in terms of both loss and gain, have been incorporated into the exante carbon calculations presented in this section. This SLR assessment also confirms the permanence of
the soil organic carbon stocks by demonstrating that the CO 2 removals being claimed by the project do not
exceed the difference between the baseline and project scenarios at t=100. The project does not alter the
hydrology of the project area or adjacent lands, therefore the project will neither be impacted nor impact
hydrologically connected areas.

The project will migrate to the VCS tidal wetland methodology, VM0033, at first verification

**3.1.3** **Project Boundary**

**ARR+RWE project boundary**

The project grouped project area and initial project activity instances are defined in Section 2.1.7 and
illustrated in Figures 5 and 6. The initial project activity instances cover an area of 7,019.80 ha.

**Geographic boundaries and sea level rise:**

An assessment of the impact of sea level rise on project boundaries and carbon stocks has been completed
over a period of 100 years (2020-2120). The full details of the mapping and modeling components of this
assessment can be found in an Annex. A publicly available digital terrain model (DTM), DeltaDTM [106], was
used to complete this analysis. The DeltaDTM has a ground spatial resolution of 1 arc-second
(approximately 30 m). Using this DTM, together with the 2020 mangrove extents in the Sine-Saloum and
Casamance estuaries as provided by Global Mangrove Watch [107], the current elevation ranges of
mangroves near the project area were determined for both estuaries. In Sine-Saloum it’s estimated that
mangroves currently exist within an elevation range of 0.1-1.3m relative to mean sea level (MSL) whilst in
Casamance they exist within 0-0.9m relative to MSL.

To estimate the changes in these elevations due to SLR, the NASA sea level projection tool [108] was used,
which depicts the median projections of global and regional SLR relative to a 1995-2014 baseline as per
the IPCC 6th Assessment Report. The SLR scenario conservatively used for this analysis was the IPCC’s
SSP5-8.5, which is a high reference scenario that represents a "business-as-usual" scenario with high

greenhouse gas emissions and no additional climate policy. The tool's SLR projection predicts a rise of
1.03 m by 2120 on the coast of Senegal. Given that both estuaries contain rivers with sediment loads that
are deposited within the intertidal areas and there is a lack of site-specific data on sediment deposition
rates, global analyses were referenced and it was assumed that mangroves can maintain elevations at 50%
of the SLR rate. The evolution of SLR over the 100-year analysis period together with the resulting effect
on mangrove elevation range in each estuary is summarized in Table 16.

Using the predicted mangrove elevation ranges detailed in Table 13 and the DeltaDTM, in ArcGIS Pro the
geographical extent of these elevation ranges were mapped in the initial project activity instances every 10
years, from 2020-2120. When an area goes from being within these mangrove elevation ranges to being
below the lower end of the range, it is assumed that any mangroves within these areas are submerged.
Table 17 details the areas within the initial activity instances that are submerged at each 10-year interval.

In addition to submergence, with increasing SLR and tidal inundation it is assumed that erosion along
channel edges will occur within both estuaries. No data are currently available for the rate of erosion within
either estuary. However, estimates of coastal erosion have been calculated by several authors. Ankrah et
al. (2023) [109] examined erosion rates near the mouths of the Sine-Saloum and Casamance rivers and
calculated rates of -3.56 m yr [-1] and -1.28 m yr [-1], respectively. Similarly, Luijendijk et al. (2018) [110] calculated
a country-level erosion rate of -1.6 m yr-1. Given the coastal zones are inherently a higher energy
environment than the sheltered channels that traverse the project area, visual inspection of the project area
in Google Earth Pro indicates an erosion rate in Sine-Saloum of approximately -1.7 m yr [-1] and little erosion
was observed within Casamance. Based on the published values and the visual inspection, a conservative
annual erosion loss of -1 m y [r-1] has been used in this analysis. The areas within the initial activity instances
lost due to erosion in each decade of the analysis period are detailed in Table 18.

If elevation, land-use and hydrological conditions are favorable, mangroves have the capacity to expand
laterally in response to rising sea levels. Therefore, based on expert judgment [111] it is also assumed that,
with SLR, mangroves within the initial activity instances will have the capacity to expand to higher elevations
at a lateral expansion rate of 100 m per decade. Using ArcGIS Pro, 100 m decadal buffers were generated
from the edge of each project area polygon. Channels and areas with existing mangroves (2020 Global
Mangrove Watch extent) were clipped from the buffers, as were areas that were not immediately connected
to the project area (i.e. buffer area that extends across a channel). Areas that overlap with other registered
VCS projects were excluded from the buffer zones, as were any areas currently under human use, as per
visual inspection in Google Earth Pro.

The areas gained and those submerged within these buffer zones were calculated over each decade in the
100-year analysis period based on the areas within the estimated mangrove elevation range for each
estuary assuming the SLR rate that accounts for accretion.

This analysis was limited to the 300 m buffer zone (Figure 24), due to uncertainties regarding the capacity
of the project to secure the necessary ownership rights to incorporate the area within the project. Thus, for
the first 30 years of the project, the buffer zone expands by 100 m every decade. After this, the area of
analysis remained fixed (Table 19).

This analysis, together with visual inspection of the elevation ranges and trends within the two estuaries,
suggests a dynamic environment, with both mangrove losses and gains over a 100-year period. Given
these findings and the potential for significant soil organic carbon sequestration as mangroves migrate
inland due to SLR, these buffer zones may be added as subsequent project activity instances at first
verification. Therefore, the ex-ante carbon calculations presented in this PD account for project CO 2
emissions and removals across both the initial project activity instances and the 300 m buffer zones.

**3.1.4** **Baseline Scenario**



The baseline scenario is justified using the “Combined tool to identify the baseline scenario and
demonstrate additionality in A/R CDM project activities, v1.0”, as is required in the methodology ARAM0014, Afforestation and Reforestation of Degraded Mangrove Habitat.

*STEP 0: Preliminary screening based on the starting date of the ARR project activity*

The starting date of the project is July 10, 2020, as referred to in Section 2.1.14. Thus, meeting the
requirement of a start date for the reforestation activity after December 31, 1999.

WeForest signed the agreement with Oceanium prior to the project start date, which demonstrates that the
incentive from carbon trading was seriously considered in the decision to proceed with the project. In
addition, there were ongoing and real actions to ensure its status as a carbon project, with the contracts
signed between the funders and the consultants for the development of the project description documents
being the evidence to support this.

*STEP 1: Identification of alternative land-use scenarios to the proposed A/R CDM project activity*

Sub-step 1a: Identify credible alternative land-use scenarios to the proposed CDM project activity

According to the additionality tool, the alternative land-use scenarios of the proposed project includes:

## CCB & VCS PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

*CCB Version 3, VCS Version 3*

This is the most likely alternative land use scenario for the degraded mangrove habitat found in the project
area. Under this scenario, there would be little regeneration of the mangroves due to low levels of mangrove
propagules and propagules not being distributed to areas needing remediation following the 1970s-1980s
droughts. Pre-project land uses would continue, for example shrimp and fish farming, but the degraded
mangrove habitat would support low fish and shrimp numbers. Ecological conditions for widespread and
sustainable mangrove regeneration would not occur in the absence of the project activity.

**Scenario 2: Natural regeneration**

Ecological Barriers

Ecological barriers make this scenario unlikely to generate significant carbon stocks. This is demonstrated
by the limited natural regeneration observed since the drought of the 1980s. Barriers include low availability
of mangrove propagules in the project area. Any natural regeneration is likely to be significantly slower and
smaller scale than what is possible through a reforestation scheme. Between 1986 and 2001, mangrove
growth did occur (demonstrating the suitability of the environment for mangroves), but was considered to
be low and insufficient to rely on natural regeneration for the widespread restoration of the area (Dieye et
al., 2013) [112]

**Scenario 3: Mangrove regeneration within the project boundaries without being registered as a VCS**
**project**

Technological, investment, institutional, and social barriers identified.

Mangrove regeneration driven by the government is unlikely given the historic underinvestment by the
Senegalese government in mangrove restoration. There has been little evidence of government-led
mangrove restoration, and this remains unlikely despite the project being situated on public lands. The
Senegalese Government lacks the financial and technical resources to launch a large-scale mangrove
restoration project, and this is reflected in the Senegal 2024 National Finance Law Budget, with only 0.88%
of the Senegal annual budget allocated to the Ministry of Environment, which must be directed to terrestrial,
tidal, and marine ecosystems. This is in contrast to other ministerial priorities like the Ministry of Higher
Education, Research and Innovation that receives 5.48% of the annual budget, and the Ministry of
Agriculture and Rural Development that also receives a higher budget share with 3.96% of the Senegal
state annual budget. [113]

## CCB & VCS PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

*CCB Version 3, VCS Version 3*

The State of Senegal is actively seeking (but not successfully as outlined below) civil society and donor
partners to fund and implement mangrove restoration projects to fill the shortfall in nationally available
resources. This is reflected in Senegal’s Nationally Determined Contributions, which identifies coastal
zones as a key priority, but stresses the need for around $5.3bn international support to meet national
mitigation targets, and $8.2bn to reach national adaptation targets by 2030. [114] Mangrove regeneration
elsewhere in Senegal is primarily driven by other carbon projects, for example as implemented by the
Livelihoods Fund, demonstrating the importance of this mechanism for delivering investment and technical
expertise.

It is unlikely that mangrove regeneration in the project area will be driven by private or civil society
organizations without it being registered as a carbon project. There has been little investment by other
organisations in the project area since the droughts of the 1970s and 1980s, and the high costs of mangrove
restoration make it prohibitive without the financing mechanism of the carbon project. Access to credit is
challenging for activities that are not profitable over time, such as mangrove restoration. Thus, the financing
of project activities is only possible thanks to the expected benefits from the commercialization of carbon
credits by the funders. Other smaller projects were developed in Senegal, however, even in projects that
secured funding for the planting phase, then lacked financial resources for long term monitoring and
remediation, leading to high mangrove mortality rates. Carbon financing will unlock activities needed during
the entire project period, guaranteeing the appropriate implementation and long-term management of the

mangroves.

The restoration activities will be executed by the NGO Oceanium, which has demonstrated a great capacity
to mobilize local communities and has experience in similar projects. However, this NGO and the local
communities, who also need WeForest and Oceanium’s technical expertise to implement the project, do
not have financial resources of their own and need external funds to carry out the project activities. Thus,
the project is developed through an initial partnership between the proponent (WeForest) and a local NGO
providing knowledge and implementation support on the ground (Oceanium).

Finally, it is unlikely that there will be large-scale mangrove restoration driven solely by community groups.
Since the area suffered widespread deforestation linked to drought in the 1980s, there has been little
attempt at large-scale community-led mangrove restoration within the project area due to limited funds,
equipment, technical skills, and seedlings. Although community reforestation initiatives do exist, they are
often carried out on small areas (Boquet 2017) [115] (5ha max) and the results often vary greatly from one
community to another. Community groups lack access to the equipment and financial resources needed
for sustainable restoration on a large-scale. With multiple competing priorities for community development,
it is unlikely that there will be social motivation to invest in mangrove restoration without external
technological and financial support.

## CCB & VCS PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

*CCB Version 3, VCS Version 3*

The barrier analysis leads to the elimination of Scenario 2 due to ecological barriers, and Scenario 3 due
to technological, institutional, investment, and social barriers. This leaves the only likely alternative scenario
as being the continuation of the pre-project land use, which is degraded mangroves. This will therefore be
used as the without-project baseline scenario.

Step 3, Investment Analysis, resultantly does not need to be performed because there are no viable
restoration scenarios other than the Project.

**3.1.5** **Additionality**

*Step 4: Common practice analysis*

There are no other mangrove afforestation, reforestation, or restoration projects on a similar scale within
the project zone. In an adjacent area there is a similar mangrove restoration grouped project managed by
the Livelihoods Fund which was registered as a VCS project in 2014, and in which Oceanium also
participates. WeForest and the Livelihoods Fund are in regular contact, and there is no overlap in activities.

There are no laws, statutes, or other regulatory frameworks or systematically enforced laws that mandate
the project activities. While the Government of Senegal does support and encourage mangrove
regeneration, this is not mandated by law. The Senegalese Nationally Determined Contributions document
mentions restoring 4,000 hectares of mangroves annually. However, there is no program from the
Senegalese government to provide the technical and financial support to operationalise this.

Thus, there is currently no similar project activity identified within the common practice boundary, so step 4
is satisfied and the proposed ARR VCS project activity is not the baseline scenario, so it is additional.

## CCB & VCS PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

*CCB Version 3, VCS Version 3*

Based on the applied methodology AR AM0014, v3.0, the baseline net GHG removals by sinks were

calculated as follows:

*ΔC* *BSL,t* = *ΔC* *TREE_BSL,t* + *ΔC* *SHRUB_BSL,,t* + *ΔC* *DW_BSL,t* (Equation 1, 1 of AR-AM0014)

Where:

|ΔC BSL,t|= Baseline net GHG removals by sinks in year t; t CO -e 2|
|---|---|
|ΔC TREE_BSL,t|= Change in carbon stock in baseline tree biomass within the project boundary in year t, as estimated in AR-Tool14; t CO -e 2|
|ΔC SHRUB_BSL,,t|= Change in carbon stock in baseline shrub biomass within the project boundary in year t, as estimated in AR-Tool14; t CO -e 2|
|ΔC DW_BSL,t|= Change in carbon stock in baseline dead wood biomass within the project boundary, in year t, as estimated in AR-Tool12; t CO -e 2|



Changes in the carbon stocks in the living biomass – ( *ΔC* *TREE_BSL,t* *+ ΔC* *SHRUB_BSL,t* )

As a mangrove restoration project, the pre-existing vegetation in the project area is made up of scattered
*Rhizophora spp.* and / or *Avicennia spp.* trees. This vegetation forms part of a highly degraded mangrove
ecosystem in which the degradation factors are multiple: the droughts of the 1970s and 1980s (Ndao, 2012;
Dieye et al., 2013), the construction of infrastructures (roads or hydro-agricultural) such as the Guidel or
Affiniam dam (Manga and Tendeng, 2010; Autumn *,* 2013) which prevented the mangrove plants from
benefiting from the tidal range throughout the duration of the works, causing high mortality of the plants due
to the excess salinity, and deforestation caused by the extraction of trees for firewood and construction.
Therefore, changes in carbon stocks in the living biomass stock of tree and non-tree vegetation are
expected to be zero in the baseline scenario.

As stated in the AR-Tool 14 Methodological Tool “Estimation of carbon stocks and change in carbon stocks
of trees and shrubs in A/R CDM project activities”, ex-ante and ex-post carbon stocks in trees and shrubs
in baseline can be counted as zero since the following conditions are met:

a) The pre-project trees are neither harvested, nor cleared, nor removed;

In the case of the project, trees are neither harvested, nor cleared, nor removed.

b) The pre-project trees do not suffer mortality because of competition from trees planted in the

project, or damage because of implementation of the project activity, at any time during the crediting
period of the project activity
#### 127

CCB v3.0, VCS v3.3

## CCB & VCS PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

*CCB Version 3, VCS Version 3*

Pre-project trees are not expected to suffer mortality because planted trees will be smaller and will not
compete for light with pre-existing trees. No site preparation is required and planting is done manually, so
no damage to pre-project trees is expected.

c) The pre-project trees are not inventoried along with the project trees in monitoring of carbon stocks

but their continued existence, consistent with the baseline scenario, is monitored throughout the
crediting period of the project activity

Pre-existing tree biomass and carbon stock change will not be monitored, but their continued presence
throughout the crediting period will be monitored. A permanent sampling is designed with the objective of
monitoring the continuous existence of the baseline trees throughout the crediting period of the project
activity. This will be quantified for exclusion from the project and integrated into the monitoring reports.

Changes in the carbon stocks in baseline dead wood biomass - *ΔC* *DW_BSL,t*

According to section 6.2 of AR-Tool12, “Conservative default-factor debased method for estimation of
carbon stock in dead wood”, *ΔC* *DW_BSL,t* may be conservatively accounted as zero since changes in the
carbon stocks in the living biomass are estimated as zero.

**3.2.2** **Project Emissions**

**3.2.2.1** **Initial Project Activity Instances**

According to the applied methodology AR AM0014, v3.0, the ex-ante actual net GHG removals by sinks
may be calculated using the below equation.

*ΔC* *ACTUAL,t* = *ΔC* *P,t* – *GHG* *E,t* (Equation 2, 2 of AR-AM0014)

Where:

|ΔC ACTUAL,t|= Actual net greenhouse gas removals by sinks at time t; t CO -e 2|

Δ *C* *P,t* is defined as the sum of changes in living biomass (above and belowground), dead wood, and soil
organic carbon stocks. It is calculated using equation 3 of the methodology:

*ΔC* *P,* t = *ΔC* *TREE_PROJ,t* + *ΔC* *SHRUB_PROJ,t* + *ΔC* *DW_PROJ,t* + *ΔC* *SOC_PROJ,t* (Equation 3, 3 of ARAM0014)

|ΔC SOC_PROJ,t|= Change in carbon stock in the soil organic carbon (SOC) pool within the project boundary, as estimated in AR-AM0014, in year t; t CO -e 2|



Change in carbon stock in tree biomass - Δ *C* *TREE_PROJ,t*

The tool “Estimation of carbon stocks and change in carbon stocks of trees and shrubs in A/R CDM project
activity, v4.2” (AR TOOL14) is used to estimate the change in carbon stock in tree biomass. Following this
tool, change in carbon stock in trees between two points of time may be estimated by using different
methods or combinations of them. In the case of the first project activity instance, ex-post estimations will
be performed using option (a), the “Difference of two independent stock estimations” method (see section
6.1 of AR-Tool14). This method is based on the carbon stock in trees at a point of time by measuring sample
plots (see section 8.1 of AR-Tool14).

In the case of the first verification of the first project activity instance, ex-post estimations of change in
carbon stock in trees between two points of time will be done using the “Difference of two independent
stock estimations” method (see section 6.1 of AR-Tool14). This will be based on measurements of sample
plots to estimate carbon stock in trees at a point of time (see section 8.1 of AR-Tool14). However, in the
case of subsequent verifications of the first instance or in the case of potential new instances, other methods

described in AR-Tool14 can also be used.

of trees over time. Thus, using the above equation, ex-ante estimations of change in carbon stock in trees
(Δ *C* *TREE* ) were done following the steps below:

**Step 1:** Selection of the allometric equations

Three allometric equations were used to estimate the aboveground biomass of trees. Two equations
developed by Fromard et al. (1998) [116] were used for *Avicenia germinans* trees with stem diameters ( *dbh* )
above and below 4 cm. Santos et al.’s (2017) equation [117] was used to estimate the aboveground biomass
of *Rhizophora mangle* and *Rhizophora racemosa* trees. Although these equations were selected for exante estimations, it is expected to use site-specific equations for ex-post calculations.

An equation developed for different mangrove species in South-East Asia, including *Rhizophora* sp. by
Komiyama et al. (2005) [118] was used for ex-ante estimations of belowground biomass. This equation
includes, among others, *ρ* *j* (wood density of tree trunk of species *j*, t/m [3] ) as an independent variable. A
value of 0.910 was used for *R. mangle*, 0.998 for *R. racemosa*, and 0.776 for *A. germinans* .

*Table 23: Allometric equations used for ex-ante estimations*

**Step 2:** Creation or selection of a diameter growth model

Based on *diameter at breast height (dbh)* data at different ages from Jiménez (1985) [119], and the ChapmanRichards function (Richards, 1959 [120] ; Pienaar and Turnbull, 1973 [121] ), a diameter growth model was fitted
for *A. germinans* . The diameter growth model used for *Rhizophora* sp. is the same as the model used in
ex-ante estimations of aboveground biomass in the “Livelihoods’ mangrove restoration grouped project in
Senegal” project for *R. mangle* and identical ecological-environmental conditions.

This step was divided into the following sub-steps:

     - Sub-step 3.1: Estimation of aboveground and belowground biomass per tree
( *f* *j* *(x* *1,l* *,x* *2,l* *,x* *3,l* *,...))* based on *dbh* growth models and using the corresponding allometric
equations

     - Sub-step 3.2: Calculation of biomass of tree *l* of species *j* ( *B* *TREE,l, j* ) defined as the sum of
*agb* and *bgb* per tree

     - Sub-step 3.3: Estimation of planting density at different points in time. Although the planting
density is planned to be 5,000 trees ha [-1] in the case of *Rhizophora* sp. and 1,000 trees ha [-]

1 in the case of *A. germinans*, density in year 30 is expected to be 2,395 trees ha -1 and 600
trees ha [-1], respectively. Conservatively, a 23% mortality rate was assumed during the first
year after plantation, 15% during the second year, 5% during the third year, and a constant
rate of 1% from year 4 to year 30, with a minimum expected density of 600 trees ha [-1] .
Mortality will be closely monitored and accounted for in remediation campaigns.

     - Sub-step 3.4: Estimation of the mean tree biomass per hectare in stratum *i* at a given point
of time in year *t* ( *b* *TREE,t,i* ) based on the planting density and *B* *TREE,l, j.*

     - Sub-step 3.5: Carbon stock in project trees was estimated using equation 5 (12 of AR-Tool
14).

This growth curve extends to 100 years to enable the analysis of the impact of SLR over the 100-year
permanence period, however, according to the species growth models, no further biomass growth is
assumed in stands over 40 years in age.

     - Sub-step 3.6: The area-weighted average growth curve detailed in Table 22 was applied
to the areas predicted to be remaining following any impact of SLR. It is conservatively
assumed that the 2020 planting cohorts are lost first due to SLR.

     - Sub-step 3.6: As explained in Section 3.1.3, tree biomass is expected to be lost within the
initial project activity instances due to SLR. It was conservatively assumed that all CO 2
stored within tree biomass is lost instantaneously to the atmosphere upon submergence.
To calculate the carbon stock losses resulting from this submergence, these areas were
multiplied by the area-weighted average growth curve for the three planting cohorts (2020,
2021 and 2022). These carbon stock losses were subtracted from the results of sub-step
3.5 to give ΔC TREE_PROJ,t .

1.46 t C ha [-1] yr [-1] for *in situ* CO 2 removals in the soil organic carbon pool. This value may only be applied to

areas with a crown or vegetation cover of at least 50%. By contrast, for areas with a crown or vegetation
cover of less than 15%, this SOC accumulation is assumed to be insignificant and accounted for as zero.
For areas with a crown or vegetation cover between 15 and 50%, a linear interpolation may be applied.

In mineral soils, VM0033 requires a deduction for allochthonous carbon to be applied to the default SOC
accumulation rate. For the purpose of these ex-ante calculations, field data were collected to estimate the
relative coverage of organic soils in the area covered by the initial project activity instances. This process
indicates that 64% of the project area is covered by organic soils and thus exempt from an allochthonous

carbon deduction.

Based on data from similar environments [122], an allochthonous deduction of 0.51 was applied to the portion
of the project covered by mineral soils. Assuming these soils cover 36% of the project area results in an
area-weighted average autochthonous SOC accumulation rate ( *dSOC* ) of **1.28 t C ha** **[-1]** **yr** **[-1]** (i.e. based on
36% with a rate of 0.95 t C ha [-1] yr [-1] and 64% with a rate of 1.46 t C ha [-1] yr [-1] ).

Based on canopy cover data from historical plantations in Senegal, it is assumed that the trees planted in
for the initial project activity instances reach a crown cover of 15% five years after planting and 50% ten
years after planting, with soil accumulation rates scaled linearly between these two time points (Table 27).

As described in Section 3.1.3, parts of the initial project activity instances will be either submerged or eroded
due to sea level rise. According to VM0033, upon only submergence, SOC is not returned to the
atmosphere. However, tree presence and growth is the driver of SOC accumulation in mangrove
ecosystems. Therefore, dSOC is only applied to areas prior to any biomass loss due to submergence.

Emissions occur from the SOC pool in an erosional environment. VM0033 provides default values for the
% of soil organic carbon lost due to oxidation in an erosional environment, dependent on the type of "carbon

preservation depositional environment". In the context of the project area, the depositional environment is
‘Normal Marine’ and the default percentage of the eroded carbon that is returned to the atmosphere is 80%.

The areas of the initial project activity instances lost due to erosion are given in Table 18. The SLR modeling
detailed in Section 3.1.3 suggests that, during the 30-year project crediting period, the average age at which
mangroves are submerged, and thus cease sequestering CO 2, is 12 years. Thus, it was conservatively
assumed that the cumulated SOC stock at t=12 (7.02 tC ha [-1] ) is at risk of erosion. The SOC carbon stock
losses due to erosion were calculated by multiplying this value by the areas in Table 18 and 80%.

These losses were subtracted from carbon stock increases due to *in situ* accumulation, to give ΔC SOC_PROJ,t .

The predicted changes in carbon stocks within each carbon pool in the initial project activity instances
together with the total carbon stock changes (ΔC P,t ) are given in Table 28.

**Increase of non-CO** **2** **GHG emissions within the project boundary -** ***GHG*** ***E,t***

Following the CDM A/R Methodological Tool “Estimation of non-CO2 GHG emissions resulting from burning
of biomass attributable to an A/R CDM project activity” [123], it was assumed that *GHG* *E,t* is = 0 since fire is
not used in site preparation or to clear the land of harvest residue prior to replanting of the land. However,
if forest fires occur during the project life, it will be reported and monitored in the ex-post verification
estimates. Emission of non-CO 2 GHGs resulting from forest fire ( *GHG* *FF,t* ) will be calculated ex-post,
specifically using equations 6, 7, and 8 of the mentioned A/R CDM methodological tool.

**3.2.2.2 Buffer Zones**

Change in carbon stocks in the tree biomass pools

As explained in Section 3.1.3, mangroves are expected to grow within the buffer zones due to sea level
rise and the seed availability provided by the project planting. Supplemental planting activities may be
considered in future phases of the grouped project if propagule quality/quantity is insufficient to expand into

the 300 m buffer zones at the expected rate. The areas of mangrove gain in each decade of the project
crediting period are detailed in Table 16. Carbon stock changes in these areas due to mangrove growth
were calculated using the same biomass growth curves and assumptions detailed in Section 3.2.2.1.

As sea levels continue to rise, regions within the buffer zone that are below the elevation range of
mangroves become submerged. It was conservatively assumed that all CO 2 stored within tree biomass is
lost instantaneously to the atmosphere upon submergence.

Given these are ex-ante calculations and modeling the impact of SLR across multiple strata over 100 years
is both complex and hard to validate, conservative simplifications have been made in the ex-ante
calculations presented in this PD, to make them easier to understand and validate. To calculate the biomass
carbon stock losses resulting from this submergence, these areas were multiplied by the average per
hectare tree biomass carbon stock at each point in time, which were calculated by dividing the cumulative
biomass carbon stocks within the buffer zone by the cumulative area of gained mangroves. These carbon
stock losses were subtracted from the carbon stock gains due to lateral mangrove expansion to give the
annual carbon stock change in tree biomass in the buffer zones.

Change in carbon stocks in the SOC pool

SOC accumulation due to lateral mangrove expansion in the buffer zones was calculated using the areas
of gain detailed in Table 16 together with the same average autochthonous SOC accumulation rates
detailed in Section 3.2.2.1. Tree presence and growth is the driver of SOC accumulation in mangrove
ecosystems. The sea level rise assessment outlined in Section 3.1.3 indicated that the average age at
which mangroves within the 100 m buffer region surrounding the project are submerged is 49 years (a
longer period compared to the average of 12 years for the original project area due to the longer time period
over which the SLR-driven migration occurs). As described above, it is assumed that tree biomass is
instantaneously lost upon submergence. Therefore, dSOC is only applied for 49 years after initial growth.

SOC loss due to erosion in the buffer zones was calculated using the areas detailed in Table 16, multiplied
by the average SOC stocks accumulated in the buffer zones in the year of analysis and the same default
percentage of the eroded carbon that is returned to the atmosphere as detailed in Section 3.2.2.1 (80%).
These carbon stock losses were subtracted from the carbon stock gains due to lateral mangrove expansion
to give the annual carbon stock change in the SOC pool in the buffer zones.

**3.2.3** **Leakage**

Activity shifting and market leakage:

As described in the new VM0033 methodology, activity-shifting and market leakage are deemed not to
occur if the applicability conditions of the methodology are met, and if pre-project land use will continue
during the project crediting period. Fishing will continue in the streams next to the plantations (plantations
are a nursery and shelter for the fish, and are thus likely to boost fish populations). In addition, fisher
communities are consulted to ensure plantation does not occur within their fishing grounds. While not
widespread in the project area, sustainable shrimp farming will continue to be allowed in the project area,
and the growth of mangroves is expected to have a positive impact on shrimp populations. Shellfish
collection can continue with mangrove plantation, and it mainly takes place in water streams on the edges
of the mangroves. Sensitization is conducted to improve awareness on how not to damage mangrove trees
when collecting shellfish. If project monitoring identifies any evidence of deforestation or mangrove
degradation, this will be addressed immediately and compensated for.

According to the applied methodology AR-AM0014 (v3.0), leakage emission is estimated as follows:

*LK* *t* = *LK* *,AGRIC,t* (Equation 16, 5 of AR-AM0014)

Where:

*LK* *t* = GHG emissions due to leakage, in year t; t CO 2 -e.
#### 144

CCB v3.0, VCS v3.3

## CCB & VCS PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

*CCB Version 3, VCS Version 3*

*LK* *,AGRIC,t* = Leakage due to the displacement of agricultural activities in year *t*, as

estimated in the tool “Estimation of the increase in GHG emissions

attributable to displacement of pre-project agricultural activities in A/R CDM
project activity”; t CO 2 -e.

Project activities are implemented in degraded mangrove areas where there was no agricultural activity
previous to the start date. Therefore, no displacement of agricultural activities would occur after the
implementation of the project ( *LK* *t* *=* 0).

If displacement of agricultural activities occurs in future project activity instances, then leakage will be
calculated using equation 5 of AR-AM0014, and equations 1, 2, and 3 of AR-TOOL15.

Ecological Leakage:

The project activities have no impact on the water table and thus do not influence GHG emissions within
wetlands outside the project areas. Therefore, ecological leakage will not occur.

**3.2.4** **Net GHG Emission Reductions and Removals**

The net anthropogenic GHG removals by the project are calculated using equation 6 of AR-AM0014 and

are summarized below:

*ΔC* *ARR-VCS,t* = *ΔC* *ACTUAL,t* - *ΔC* *BLS,* t - *LK* *,t* Equation 20, 6 of AR-AM0014)

Where:

|ΔC ARR-VCS,t|= Net anthropogenic GHG removals by sinks, in year t; t CO -e 2|
|---|---|
|ΔC ACTUAL,t|= Actual net GHG removals by sinks, in year t; t CO -e 2|
|ΔC BLS,t|= Baseline net GHG removals by sinks, in year t; t CO -e 2|
|LK,t|= GHG emissions due to leakage, in year t; t CO -e 2|



This calculation must reflect the net GHG emission reductions in both the initial project activity instances
and the buffer zones. Therefore, in equation 20, *ΔC* *ACTUAL,t* represents the actual net GHG removals by
sinks in both areas. Table 30 shows the resulting estimated net GHG emissions reductions and removals.

WRC projects are required to demonstrate that the permanence of their soil carbon stock will be maintained.
The maximum quantity of GHG emission reductions that may be sought by the project is limited to the
difference between project and baseline scenario after a 100-year time frame. The difference between the
project and baseline scenario at t=100 is 3,494,726 tCO 2 e. The total net emission removals that the project
is expected to produce, 1,477,455 tCO 2 e, is below this figure, therefore the project satisfies this requirement

of the VCS.

Applying the 13% pooled buffer account allocation to the net removals shown in Table 31 gives the expected

net VCUs.

## CCB & VCS PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

*CCB Version 3, VCS Version 3*

1. Verification that the applicability conditions of the methodology have been met. The

applicability conditions that shall be demonstrated ex-post during the next verification event

are:

a) More than 90% of the project area is planted with mangrove species. If more than 10%

of the project area is planted with non-mangrove species, then the project activity does
not lead to alteration of hydrology of the project area and hydrology of connected upgradient and down-gradient wetland area
b) Soil disturbance attributable to the ARR project activity does not cover more than 10%

of area

c) Displacement of agricultural activities does not cause, directly or indirectly, any

drainage of wetlands
2. Verification of changes in carbon stocks in the pools selected: methodology described in

the sub-section “Monitoring of net anthropogenic GHG removals”.
3. Verification of project emissions and leakage emissions: methodology described in the sub
section “Monitoring of net anthropogenic GHG removals”.

The monitoring plan will be refined and brought in line with VM0033 before first verification.

PROJECT BOUNDARY MONITORING

This is a key activity during the monitoring of the project. Thus, the geographic coordinates of the boundary
of each parcel within the project area have been and will be defined. This includes all areas of lateral
expansion and/or planting in the buffer zone. Field surveys using GPS, satellite imagery, and GIS software
have been used in this activity.

Usually, two teams have been working simultaneously, one in the Casamance Delta and the other one in
the Sine-Saloum Delta. The team leader was a GIS and GPS expert in charge of the training of the teams,
the work planning, and the data collection, merge, storage, and analysis.

Due to the particular nature of the project, with multiple small and scattered plots, it is necessary to plan
the fieldwork before the measurement campaign. Key aspects considered for planning were tide, parcel
location, and means of transport (motorbike, pirogue, etc.).

STRATIFICATION AND SAMPLING DESIGN

Stratification

Biomass distribution over the project area is not homogeneous; therefore, stratification should be carried
out to improve the precision of biomass estimation. Different stratifications may be required for the baseline
and the project scenarios are always looking for higher homogeneity inside each stratum to improve
precision.
#### 161

CCB v3.0, VCS v3.3


-----

## CCB & VCS PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

*CCB Version 3, VCS Version 3*

Baseline stratification was done based on the land-use type. Since in the first project activity instance the
whole area is severely degraded mangrove habitat, only one strata was considered in baseline estimations
(see Section 3.2.1).

Stratification for ex-ante estimations of actual net GHG removals by sinks was primarily conducted based
solely on tree species and planting year. In future verifications, and as the differences in growth and
mortality rates become noticeable between the different zones of the project area, the stratification criteria
might be readapted before first verification.

The following table summarizes the nine strata described in Section 3.2.2.

*Table 34: Stratification of first project activity instance*

Sampling design, plot selection, and location

The project will use an independent monitoring that will be based on a fixed size plot and a random sampling
using temporal sample plots to estimate carbon stock in trees for monitoring of project activities. Both
monitoring will be independent and the location of the selected pre-existing trees will not depend on the
different stratifications that may occur in each verification event.

*Pre-existing trees monitoring* :
#### 162

CCB v3.0, VCS v3.3

## CCB & VCS PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

*CCB Version 3, VCS Version 3*

Remote sensing images from 2020 will be compared with those taken at each verification event to monitor
the presence of pre-existing trees.

*Sampling for carbon stocks estimation* :

The project will use temporal circular sample plots randomly located in each stratum, ensuring that the
entire area of the plot is within the boundaries of the planting area. The sample plot area will be determined
before each verification event. For the first verification, the size of the sample plot in every stratum was
defined ex-ante to be 314 m [2] (radius = 10m). This sample plot size is according to recommended size by
the IPCC [126] of 100m².

The number of samples and sample size will be determined using “Calculation of the number of sample
plots for measurements within A/R CDM project activities (Version 02.1.0)” to reach the targeted precision

level of ±10% of the mean of the measured variables at the 90% confidence level in a cost-effective manner.

The number of required sample plots (n) will be calculated using equation 2 of the abovementioned tool,
since the sampled area is expected to be less than 5% of the project area:

During the monitoring process, a re-assessment of the plot size and plot number based on the variance
may be necessary depending on the characteristics of the ex-post strata. The date of last measurement of
sample plot will be considered to be the date of estimation of carbon stock, even if the full process of
measurement extends over a period of time.

MONITORING OF NET ANTHROPOGENIC GHG REMOVALS

Ex-post estimation of the baseline net GHG removals by sinks

The AR-TOOL14 methodological tool is used to estimate baseline net GHG removals by sinks in A/R CDM
project activities, as described in Section 3.2. Baseline net GHG removals by sinks shall not be monitored
during the crediting period.

Ex-post estimation of the actual net GHG removals by sinks

The monitoring of the GHG removals will be based on the above explained monitoring of the project
boundary, the stratification of the project and the sampling design.

Forest establishment will be supervised, reporting on the verification that the planting has been completed.
This process will be monitored after the end of the planting period and recorded in a database (during the
first two years).

Ex-post estimation of leakage

## CCB & VCS PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

*CCB Version 3, VCS Version 3*

Displacement of pre-project agricultural activities will not occur in the first project activity, being duly
justified, but specific data will not need to be monitored for the assessment of this source of leakage. In
future instances of the project activity, if displacement of agricultural activities occurs, these will be

monitored based on AR-TOOL15.

QUALITY ASSURANCE AND QUALITY CONTROL (QA / QC) PROCEDURES

QA and QC procedures shall be implemented to ensure that anthropogenic net removals of GHGs by sinks
are measured and monitored in an accurate, verifiable, and credible manner. The implementing
organization will be required to design a quality management and quality assurance system to ensure good
management, quality, and reliability of the information. The QA / QC system shall conform to IPCC
recommendations. To provide consistency in the processes, protocols and manuals should be developed
for all project activities as follows:

Verification of field data

Data recorded on the field forms will be monitored and evaluated to identify the accuracy and consistency
of the sampling data, and to verify that the required percentage error is met (10%). If errors are identified,
they will be corrected and documented, not to exceed 5%; if the error is greater, sources of the mistakes
will be identified and the plantation monitoring protocol will be updated. The same procedures will be used
throughout the life of the project to ensure continuity.

Review of information processing: in order to identify possible inconsistencies, the data collected in the field
and recorded in the digital systems will be reviewed for a permanently selected sample of 10% of the
records. If the typing error is greater than 10%, the entire data should be reviewed, and the necessary

corrections made.

Data recording and archiving system

Standard operating procedures will be established for all procedures such as GIS analysis, field
measurements, data entry, data documentation, and data storage.

The information collected will be stored in an organized and secure manner in both digital and physical
formats. Each file should contain field forms, estimates of changes in carbon content (equations and
calculations), geographic information (GIS), and measurement and monitoring reports.

Collected data will be archived for a period of at least two years after the last crediting period of the project
activity, in accordance with AR-AM0014 methodology.

OPERATIONAL AND MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE

A well-trained monitoring unit will perform the monitoring (field survey, data collection, QA / QC, GHG
removals, etc.). The monitoring unit will have the following structure:
#### 165

CCB v3.0, VCS v3.3

## CCB & VCS PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

*CCB Version 3, VCS Version 3*

     - Monitoring teams: in charge of field measurements and data collection in field forms and
digital databases. It is expected that each team will be formed at least by two people, one
in charge of measurements and the other in charge of data collection and Unmanned Aerial
Vehicle (UAV) flight performance (if required). These teams will be coordinated by the
implementing partner (Oceanium in the case of the first activity instance).

     - Coordinator: will be responsible for the coordination of the monitoring teams and the person
in charge of data analysis and data quality. This person, belonging to the implementing
partner, will be in charge of team training, data quality, data processing and storage, and
technical and logistical management.

     - Forest carbon expert: in charge of GHG removals and QC / QA calculations.

Financial resources for the Monitoring Plan will be provided by WeForest.

**3.3.4** **Dissemination of Monitoring Plan and Results (CL4.2)**

The Monitoring Plan, documentation, and information on the results of monitoring, as well as each
verification of this project will be published on the VERRA platforms, where stakeholders will be able to
easily download them.

During each verification, the monitoring unit will summarize the Monitoring Plan and results to be
communicated to the communities and other stakeholders. In addition, the monitoring unit will summarize
all comments received from stakeholders and related responses regarding the Monitoring Plan and results,
and will post them on the VERRA website along with the monitoring report for each monitoring period. See
Section 2.3.2 for more details on the dissemination of project documents to communities and workers.
##### **4 COMMUNITY ** **4.1 Without-Project Community Scenario **

**4.1.1** **Descriptions of Communities at Project Start (CM1.1)**

Sections 2.1.6 and 2.1.9 mentioned that there are 17 communities included in the project zone, twelve from
Casamance and five from Sine-Saloum. In each community, different villages are included. The total
population of all communities is 297 794, based on projections from the last census conducted in Senegal
in 2014 (Agence Nationale de la Statistique et de la Démographie).

The inhabitants’ survival in both areas heavily depends on natural resources. Their economic activities
differ depending on their proximity to the mangrove. While the communities near the mangrove are more
oriented toward aquaculture activities (fishing and oyster collection), the more inland communities base
their economic activities on agriculture. Most families raise some animals for their consumption.

The main ethnic groups are described in Section 2.1.6. Traditional and religious leaders are very relevant
in how communities are structured and how they make decisions.

## CCB & VCS PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

*CCB Version 3, VCS Version 3*

Senegal’s Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are community based. This means that the governance of
Senegal’s community marine areas is ensured by the riparian communities (through the management
committee) and the State services (Directorate of Community Marine Protected Areas and Fisheries
Services). The community marine-protected areas are therefore community-based mechanisms, although
they are co-managed with public institutions [127] . Senegalese marine and coastal areas play an important
role in the socio-economic life and the conservation of national, sub-regional, and global biodiversity
(migratory species). For example, at the national level, fishing contributes significantly to job creation
(600,000 jobs), food security (more than 70% of animal protein intake), wealth creation (more than 240
billion per year), and significantly reducing national debt (first foreign exchange inflow sector) (Ministry of
Fisheries and Maritime Affairs, 2013; Diouf et al., 2016) [128] .

Tourism, which largely takes place in the marine and coastal zone, is the second largest source of foreign
exchange inflows in Senegal after fishing. Revenue from tourism represented nearly 500 billion CFA francs,
or 7% of GDP in 2017. This sector generates more than 100,000 jobs nationally.

As described in Section 2.1.9, residents in Casamance villages are active in a variety of livelihoods. Rice
growing remains the central activity of the population, but they are also involved in animal husbandry, fishing
and traditional fish farming, market gardening, and collection of sea products, etc.

In Sine-Saloum, as in all the villages of the groundnut basin, the primary activity is agriculture, with family
farms for self-consumption including groundnuts, millet, and corn. Rice cultivation is also an essential
activity with areas of up to 100ha. Rice is both marketed and consumed by households, except in the village
of Sakhor, where production is entirely consumed by households. The people of the Sine-Saloum who live
near mangrove areas are more involved in the fisheries sector (mainly shrimp, fish and oyster harvesting).

Households in the Saloum Delta are developing strategies to diversify their activities to meet their needs
(see Figure 11). Thus, in addition to income from mangrove socio-economic goods and services,
households practice agriculture, trade, livestock (poultry, sheep, goats, etc.), market gardening, and benefit
from purchases from migrants. [129]

*CCB Version 3, VCS Version 3*

The mangrove ecosystem goods and services on which the majority of members of households in the SineSaloum depend, include oyster farming, mangrove beekeeping, seafood harvesting, fishing, salt
exploitation, and the processing of fishery products.

*Figure 25: Major traditional activities carried out in the mangrove ecosystem of the Saloum Delta* *[130]*

In Casamance, rice is still the main crop, with an estimated area of more than 40,000ha and an annual
production of nearly 100,000 tons. Millet, peanuts, corn, sorghum, and cowpeas are the next top crops. The
region also produces a lot of fruits, the most cultivated being mango, but also oranges, mandarins,
grapefruits, and bananas.

The cultivation of cashew is also important to the area. The cashew nut is mostly exported and used as an
appetizer and in the chocolate industry. The pulp of the cashew apple, very rich in vitamin C, is used to
make jam and fruit juice and ‘soum-soum’, an artisanal alcohol obtained after fermentation of the pulp.

After the rice harvest, the Casamance people engage in other activities. The men fish, build, or maintain
houses, build bamboo hedges, and harvest palm wine, called ‘bunuk’. This area is known for its palm wine
production. The women carry out several activities including market gardening, salt production, mangrove
oyster collection, and shellfish harvesting, fish processing, and palm oil preparation. Livestock farming is
also an important activity for this region, which has a high forage potential. Its contribution to the income of

the populations is quite important. Livestock is mainly made up of small ruminants (sheep and goats) and
large ruminants, typically owned by wealthier families. Sales involve both small and large ruminants,
depending on the circumstances. These livestock sales are generally used for food expenses.

The populations traditionally use the mangrove for beekeeping, salt collection, and the exploitation of
halieutic resources: fish, oysters, and other shellfish (See Figure 26).

*Figure 26: The main traditional activities carried out in the Casamance mangrove ecosystem* *[131]*

Rice cultivation remains the main activity in Casamance. Fishing is also practiced by a large part of the
population, especially men. However, it remains a secondary activity, as it is practiced at the end of the
work day in the field during the rainy season and throughout the dry season. The catches generally consist
of fish (tilapia, ethmalosa, ‘captain’ fish, etc.), and shrimp (pink or black), which are mainly used for family
consumption. The gathering of oysters and the collection of shellfish is the work of women as well as the
production of salt. Both salt and oysters are for family consumption, donation, and sale in homes, by
hawking, or at the market (Bassene et al., 2016) [132] .

## CCB & VCS PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

*CCB Version 3, VCS Version 3*

In Casamance, after the rice-growing work of the rainy season, people devote themselves to small-scale
food production and, increasingly, to commercial production [133] . Several competing activities intermingle:
market gardening, planting fruit trees, crushing palm nuts for oil, fishing in the rice fields, fish processing,
oyster harvesting, salt extraction, shellfish and dead wood collection, etc.

In Section 2.1.6 there is a detailed description of communities. The following describes the main activities
linked to mangrove areas. In Casamance, men mainly fish and women mainly collect oysters, fixed on the
*Rhizophora* roots ( *Crassostrea gaza* r). In the Saloum Delta, women collect oysters (yoxos in Wolof), but
mainly bivalves (Anadara senilis, Murex sp., Cymbium sp., respectively in Wolof pañe, tuffë, and yeet).

The Diola women of Casamance are primarily oyster gatherers, while the Niominka and Soce women of
the Saloum give priority to the harvesting of the arches (Anadara senilis) on the mudflats of the delta.
According to the inquiries in the Saloum Delta made by the authors [134], shellfish work (harvesting and
processing) represents the major activity of nearly 92% of the women of Saloum Delta in terms of time
allotted to that activity and the main source of income for nearly 76% of those women (the sole source of
income for nearly 7% of them). In Casamance, a similar importance is linked to oyster work in the villages
of the Casamance river estuary or Lower Casamance, notably in the islands of Blis-Karone, Boulouf, and
Bandial. In the vicinity, and upstream of Ziguinchor, most of the harvesters are Arame Diola or Felupe,
refugees coming from Bissau-Guinea and settled in the city of Ziguinchor. Table 35 shows the task
distribution in Casamance according to seasonality.

**4.1.2** **Interactions between Communities and Community Groups (CM1.1)**



As the mayors are the traditional authority that the project engages with, this section looks at the interactions
between the mayors and various important community groups and stakeholders.

Interaction between mayors and community groups

According to article 71 of the general code of territorial authorities, the commune is a territorial collectivity,
a legal entity under public law. It groups together the inhabitants (community) of a given locality, made up
of neighborhoods and/or villages united by a sense of solidarity resulting from neighborliness, willing to look
after their own interests and able to find the necessary resources for action that is specific to them within
the national community and in the interests of the nation. The mayor is elected by the community and is

## CCB & VCS PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

*CCB Version 3, VCS Version 3*

representative of the commune and its inhabitants and is in charge of the local development and the
execution of the acts of the state. The residents elect the mayor and the municipality council members.

Once the results of the municipal elections have been published, the whole community accepts the results
and recognizes the authority of the mayor and his council to make decisions binding on the commune and
the community. However, it cannot be ruled out that community members supporting the opposition may
analyze the mayor's actions through a political prism. It is possible that certain activities promoted by the
mayor and his council could be analyzed by them as partisan activities (even if this is not based on
evidence). To avoid this, the project will organize community awareness-raising activities to involve them
more closely in the project's decisions, and to help them understand the reasons behind the decisions

taken.

Interaction between mayors and local authorities

The mayors are supported in all their activities by decentralized government departments. In the case of
this project, the mayors are supported and advised by the conservators of community protected areas and
the water and forestry inspectorate. In addition, the capacity of the mayors of the project's communes vary
widely (from very literate to not very literate). Thus, for all decisions taken by the municipal council, the
prefect or sub-prefect must ensure the validity of decisions taken by the municipal council and acts signed

Interaction between mayors and foreign fisherman

Some of the waterways in the communities where we work are frequented by fishermen from other
communities or even other countries. These fishermen are not anchored in the intervention communes, but

stay there occasionally for the fishing campaigns. These foreign fishermen do not form a compact,
unchanging group, which makes it difficult to keep track of them. Mayors do not have the necessary
resources to implement communication strategies aimed at these foreign fishermen, as they are dispersed
and change from one year to the next. In order to communicate with these players, town councils rely on
the artisanal fishing committees, which each year provide awareness-raising activities aimed at foreign
fishermen, informing them on a number of subjects, including biological rest periods, authorized fishing
zones, the ban on cutting mangrove wood, and the risks incurred by non-compliance with the
rules.Interaction between mayors and socio-economics groups.

The mayors wish to support all economic operators active in their communities. However, not all town halls
have the financial or technical capacity to support foreign economic operators. The mayors are aware of
the economic operators present in their communes and invite those who are not to formalize in order to
benefit from possible subsidies (infrequent) from the government, banking institutions or development
projects. Mayor support for socio-economic operators can be considered extremely limited and the relation
between those two groups are limited.

**4.1.3** **High Conservation Values (CM1.2)**

Since there is no specific report for the HCV assessment in Senegal, an evaluation has been made following
the Common Guidance for the Identification of HCV. According to the Guide, the only HCV identified in the
project zone is HCV 6: Cultural values. Two sites exist which are identified as HCV 6, as shown in the tables

below.

*Table 36: High Conservation Value Emblematic ICCA*

This community is an area inhabited nearly exclusively by Djola people. The Djola people are aware of the degradation of the coastal environment due to indiscriminate fishing and resource extraction, and they have created an association of fishermen to conserve and preserve the mangroves. The representative of the community, the mayor of Mangagoulack, has been invited to the participative process and has signed an agreement for the participation of the community in the project. https://www.iccaconsortium.org/index.php/2014/12/15/an-icca-in- casamance-the-story-of-kawawana/|

##### **4.1.4 Without-Project Scenario: Community (CM1.3)**

The without-project scenario is described in Section 2.2 and analyzed in Section 3.1.4. The most-likely
land-use scenario is continuation of pre-project use (the land as a degraded wetland). Under the withoutproject scenario, no changes in the well-being conditions of the communities are expected.

Income activities are mainly based on natural resources exploitation like fishing and agriculture for example.
In the areas of the project that are close to agricultural land, the phenomenon of salinisation of the land will
continue, leading to a reduction in the number of rice fields in Casamance. In addition, education level is
low, and very often they lack resources to buy school supplies. Cases of inappropriate use of resources
are not exceptional, and conflicts between the local communities and foreign fishermen (table 33) could
continue to happen. In 2020, a conflict occurred between native and non-native fishermen based on the
non-respect of local resources management rules. In the framework of a slow mangrove natural
regeneration, the competition for natural resources access will continue.

During the participatory process, two workshops were performed in Sine-Saloum and Casamance areas.
Social and biodiversity projections under a without-project land-use scenario were conducted and the
following was concluded:

     - Lack of political will in the development framework due to a lack of identification of local
resources from government

     - Weak training and information for communities

     - Weak organization of local producers

     - Weak access to finance

     - Lack of access to alternative employment opportunities

The communities will continue using the local resources (oysters, salt, fish, etc.) as main livelihoods using
the existing traditional ways of production.

Mangrove oysters grow on mangrove roots. Whilst it is a widely consumed product in Senegal, the absence
of mangroves represents a loss of income for local people, who could have generated income by
sustainably collecting oysters from the roots of reforested mangroves (using a knife to remove oysters from
the roots while leaving the roots intact). In addition, there is a lack of access to markets due to the long
distances from fishing sites to markets and poor producer group organization [135] .

## CCB & VCS PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

*CCB Version 3, VCS Version 3*

*Figure 29: Project area before the plantation* *[136]* *(* Source: WeForest)

Production of honey in Senegal has fallen to less than 100kg/beekeeper and campaign. National production
fell by 20% from 2003 to 2015, and the prices are variable: 3,000-5,000 FCFA/kg (4.5-7.6 €/kg). Under
these conditions, the profit margin for beekeepers is very low. At national and local levels a legal framework
does not exist to define the standards for honey production. There is a lack of organization in the sector
despite the high demand because of the weak integration of the honey sector’s actors in the market system.
The beekeeping sector will likely continue to reduce because of the precarious conditions derived from the
production and sale of honey.

In the project zone, the fishermen organizations are weak, and the main fishery organizations (National
Federation of Fishing Economic Interest Groups of Senegal and local artisanal fisheries committee) are
under-represented at the village level. A lack of infrastructure exists for the conservation of fishery products
and for the correct development of fisheries. The prices are variable depending on the kind of species: the
rarer fish are sold by 1021-6167 FCFA (1.56-9.40 €/kg), and the more common fish are sold at 50-964

FCFA (0.08-1.47 €/kg). The majority of the fishery products are sold to wholesalers (70%), and the rest are
sold in local markets [137] .

In the long term, mangrove resources will continue to be scarce and so will the income they can generate
(oysters, fish, etc.). The low opportunities in natural resources exploitation and the lack of income will cause
displacement and food insecurity for local communities.

The possible projections under the without-project scenario were worked on during the project Social and
biodiversity impact assessment (SBIA) workshop. The key outcomes highlighted by the communities if the
project is not implemented included: (1) cessation of implementation of reforestation and socio-economic
activities; (2) conflicts between project stakeholders due to poor communication between actors; (3)
threatened resources due to continued pressure.

Without the project, the following trends are expected:

  - Fewer income activities relying upon unproductive systems due to the deterioration of the

mangrove.

  - Lack of training in sustainable fishing and agriculture resulting in very rudimentary and
environmentally unfriendly methods.

  - Lack of training in sustainable governance resulting in poor governance outcomes (conflicts among
stakeholders and the risk of corruption).
##### **4.2 Net Positive Community Impacts ** **4.2.1 Expected Community Impacts (CM2.1)**

The socio-economic component of the project aims to sustainably improve the livelihoods of communities
living alongside mangrove ecosystems by strengthening their access to, and participation in, the market
system for local produce.

The project will be implemented in 17 communes in the natural regions of Casamance and Sine Saloum,
following a systemic "Market Access" approach.

Activities are articulated around four outcomes that will address the above-mentioned gaps in support
services, coordination in value chains and governance of interventions. It will be implemented through a
participatory diagnostic process, with the following results:

  - Result 1: Market shares and incomes of mangrove producers are increased by strengthening their
capacities in sustainable production techniques, organization and entrepreneurship;

#### 178

CCB v3.0, VCS v3.3

## CCB & VCS PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

*CCB Version 3, VCS Version 3*

  - Result 2: Barriers to producers' effective participation in the market system are reduced through
better market knowledge, networking, and the development of strategic partnerships within a fair
trade logic;

  - Result 3: Fair and transparent ecological mangrove value chains are established through a
participatory certification process;

  - Result 4: livelihood intervention's effectiveness is strengthened by developing synergies with other
mangrove interventions and facilitating institutionalized exchange frameworks.

The project's main activities are: i) strengthening technical, organizational, and entrepreneurial capacities;
ii) upgrading value-added chains through the development of strategic partnerships and SGP agroenvironmental certification; and iii) reinforcing concerted action between stakeholders and action synergies.
Their implementation will aim to increase the income of mangrove producers, while guaranteeing
sustainable protection and management of these ecosystems.

In addition to supporting market access, the project is implementing awareness-raising activities (ex:
cinema debate) aimed at communities, so that they can have an informed opinion on the decisions they will
be making, particularly when it comes to exploiting resources from mangrove forests.

The planting of almost 7,020 ha of land, and the promotion of sustainable value chain (fisheries, oyster
collection, beekeeping, salt, etc.), will be a great opportunity to strengthen the resilience of the local
populations in the face of food insecurity. The specific consideration given to women and young people,
through support for their integration into market systems, helps to boost the gender aspect of the economic
and social development process in the communes concerned by the project.

## CCB & VCS PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

*CCB Version 3, VCS Version 3*

Under the with-project scenario, local people will be made aware of the relevance of mangrove ecosystems,
and develop sustainable economies based on traditional knowledge. Business development will incorporate
training and capacity building involving local people in other project activities.

*Figure 31: Workshop at Sine-Saloum (Source: Oceanium)*

It is expected that around 10,900 people from local communities involved in the project will improve their
skills and knowledge resulting from training (on plantations and socio-economics activities) provided as part
of the project activities (5,000 people through socio-economic activities, and 5,900 through plantation
activities and HSSE training). The implementation of project activities will allow local people to obtain
sustainable economic development and land use. Around 5,000 people (3,000 women) [139] will see their
incomes increased due to the development of sustainable businesses associated with mangrove forests.

139 The project aimed to support at least 5 000 producers involved in socio-economics value chains. See the

Proposition Technique Eclosio Livelihoods Final WF-VF as supporting documentation. The target beneficiaries are
women and young people. Thus, we plan to support at least 60% of women in the IGAs.

The project is expected to generate temporary employment for 5,900 [140] people (community members hired
for planting activities) during the total project lifetime, with 1,770 [141] of them being women.

The anticipated net well-being impact has been identified thanks to impact assessment carried out in 2017
on the mangrove restoration project implemented by Oceanium and the Livelihoods Carbon Fund 10 years
after the plantation [142] . This assessment highlights the most net positive impacts that have been identified.

It includes:

   - Fish harvesting, oysters, shrimps, and shellfish

   - Social impacts: awareness, pride, social mobilization, solidarity
Regulatory services: less erosion, salinization, swell, wind impact, and protection of rice fields, coasts,
villages, and channels (bolongs).

##### **4.3.2 Mitigation of Negative Impacts on Other Stakeholders (CM3.2)**

One of the focal aspects proposed during the workshops was taking into account the foreign fishermen in
the design of the project, and so a representative of foreign fishermen was invited to participate in the
design [143] . Through this process it was determined that the main measure needed to mitigate any negative
impact in the well-being of foreign fishermen people is the strengthening of awareness for and
communication with them, in order to obtain a good understanding of the ecological and socio-economic
aspects of the project, and enhance their participation in all stages of the project.

##### **4.3.3 Net Impacts on Other Stakeholders (CM3.3)**

The net impacts on the well-being of other stakeholders are positive and are similar to those expected for
the local communities, as mentioned above: there will be an exchange of experiences, technical knowledge
and skills between the actors involved, a better and sustainable use of the natural resources resulting in
the conservation and protection of mangrove areas.
##### **4.4 Community Impact Monitoring **

**4.4.1** **Community Monitoring Plan (CM4.1, CM4.2, GL1.4, GL2.2, GL2.3, GL2.5)**

The Community Monitoring Plan takes into account the net community impacts expected for the local
people from the project. The information collected in the cinema debates, the field visits, workshops,
interviews, and surveys has been used to develop the community baseline of the project. Regular surveys
will monitor the project’s impact on communities in the project zone. Communities will be surveyed with
quantitative and qualitative questions, including open and closed questions. The survey will be conducted
regularly before each verification period and in a representative number of households both in Sine-Saloum
and Casamance (at least 100 households – 50 in each region will be considered).

## CCB & VCS PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

*CCB Version 3, VCS Version 3*

The indicators selected will be monitored in the future to assess the impact of the project on the local
communities, and they will demonstrate that the HCV related to community well-being will not be negatively
affected by the project activities.

The table below includes the key variables to be observed for this monitoring period. It is worth mentioning
that some of the indicators included in the Community Monitoring Plan are the same as those considered
for the Biodiversity Monitoring Plan since they serve to demonstrate both community and biodiversity
aspects. These include: (a) water quality; (b) abundance and structure of fish and oysters; (c) the number
of anthropogenic events, such as illegal logging or poaching.

The protocols for monitoring and evaluating these indicators will be developed before first verification with
a standardized scoring system for replicability.

All impact indicators (perceived changes, benefits, etc) are planned over 30 years, except activity indicators
(eg. training, sensitization activities) that are only planned within the first 10 years.

Mangrove forests grow at tropical and subtropical latitudes [144] . They grow in the muddy soil of deltas,
riverbanks, lagoons, and seashores [145] . They contribute not only to the filtering of pollution and the quality
of coastal waters (Schaffelke et al., 2005) [146] but they also constitute a physical barrier that mitigates the
erosive (and sometimes deadly) effect of storms, hurricanes, or even tsunami swells (e.g. Tanaka et al.,
2007) [147] . In addition, these ecosystems are refuges and habitats acting as feeding and reproduction places
for many animal species (birds, crabs, shrimp, mollusks, etc.).

## CCB & VCS PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

*CCB Version 3, VCS Version 3*

Senegal’s mangroves are located in the Casamance Estuary, in the Saloum Delta, and the mouth of the
Senegal River. They cover an estimated area of about 2,000km [2] (Oceanopolis, 2020) [148] . The project zone
is included within the Casamance Estuary and the Saloum Delta. These two areas have in common a fairly
dense network of bolongs, surrounded by a vast expanse of mangroves functioning as an inverted estuary.
Salinity is a factor for the mangrove ecosystem and this increases from downstream to upstream (Sow,
2019) [149] .

These estuarine areas have been classified as important mangrove ecosystems in Senegal, and for this
reason, they have been protected in recent years. It is important to mention that the plantation areas in
Saloum Delta are completely within the Saloum Delta Biosphere Reserve (abbreviated in French as RBDS),
and around 45% of the areas in Casamance belong to the MPA Niamone Kalounaye (Figure 33).

The following sections describe the habitat and biodiversity in Saloum Delta and Casamance Estuary.

***A.*** **Saloum Delta: vegetation and fauna**

The Saloum Delta is located 150km south of Dakar, around 50km southwest of Kaolack, and 20km from

Banjul, in northern Gambia. The Delta, which also extends across the border into Gambia, is formed by
several rivers, including the Saloum, Sine, Bandiala, and Diombos. The Delta covers an estimated area of
500,000ha, which includes around 60-80,000ha of mangroves (UNESCO, 2011) [150], that is, about 30% of
the mangroves in Senegal. The information on biodiversity in the Delta has been fully studied due to the
protected area status in the region. It was first named a national park in 1976, a Biosphere Reserve in 1981,
then Ramsar Site in 1984, and finally a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2011 (PAG-PNDS, 2021) [151] . The
project area in Saloum Delta is completely within the Saloum Delta Biosphere Reserve.

*Vegetation*

The Delta is characterized by a mosaic of ecosystems. First, a continental domain, represented by clear
and dry forests interspersed by forest galleries (classic habitats of the Colobus bai in Saloum), and
mangrove vegetation. The mangrove vegetation in the Delta is composed of six species which occupy 25%
of the RBDS [152] :

  - *Rhizophora racemosa*

  - *Rhizophora mangle*

  - *Rhizophora harrisonnii* (rarely)

  - *Laguncularia racemosa*

  - *Avicennia africana*

  - *Conocarpus erectus*

The distribution of mangrove species is different according to their geographical and ecological conditions.
Thus, *Rhizophora* formation is dominant within the islands, while *Avicennia spp.* appears on the transition
between the inlets and the continent where *Avicennia spp.* and *Rhizophora* coexist with good topographic
positions in trenches: *Rhizophora spp.* is found on the lower parts and *Avicennia spp.* on the higher parts.
The continental mangrove of Saloum extends from the mouth to Foundiougne where the *Rhizophora*
occupies the northern and southern banks of the rivers, while the *Avicennia spp.* grows behind the

*Rhizophora* band. However, upstream from Foundiougne, *Avicennia spp.* becomes dominant on a thinner
strip [153] .

This mangrove ecosystem is frequently separated from the forest by a sandy and muddy expanse: the
tannes [154] .

*Fauna*

Salinity is very pronounced in some areas of the RBDS, ranging from 20% to 94% *[155]* . The differences in
salinity between the coast and inland benefit fish biodiversity, because ecological conditions change from
downstream to upstream. Historical studies [156] have identified more than 200 species of fish. Crustaceans,
mollusks, turtles, and marine mammals, such as dolphins and manatees, are present in the RBDS. As for
avian fauna, more than 250 species have been listed in the RBDS [157] .

The following list shows the species that have some degree of vulnerability according to the IUCN red list.
The complete list of species can be found in the supporting documentation.

*Vegetation*

Two categories of physical environments can be distinguished within this area: on the one hand, a wetland
of maritime marshes and basins along the coast, and watercourses sheltering massive mangroves, tannes,
and rice fields flooded. On the other hand, a dry land environment where varied rainfed agriculture is
practiced within wooded formations of varying density between gallery forest to open savannah.

In the Casamance Estuary, mangrove ecosystems cover 9% of its area (Borrini-Feyerabend et al., 2009) [158] .
They are composed of *R.racemosa*, *R. harissonii*, and *R. mangle*, of the genus *Rhizophora* ; *Avicennia*
*nitida* or *Avicennia africana*, *Laguncularia racemosa* and *Conocarpus erectus*, all *Combretaceae* (Diatta et
al., 2017) [159] .

Species of the genus *Rhizophora* are found along streams, while of the genus *Avicennia* species are found
in mudflats. The distribution of these species is influenced by salinity. *Avicennia* spp. can tolerate higher
salinity than *Rhizophora* sp., due to an adaptation that allows leaves and roots to exude salt (Laffargue,
2010) [160] .

*Laguncularia racemosa*, sometimes mixed with *Rhizophora* species, develops on mounds, sometimes with
*Avicennia nitida*, and does not have a determined ecological area. Its position depends on tide level and
topography. It is a small shrub in Casamance (1 to 2m height). Behind *Rhizophora* sp. grows *Avicennia*
spp. The species *Conocarpus erectus* occupies the rear mangrove, rarely inundated.

*Fauna*

Kantousasan et al. (2012) [161] has revealed the presence of 59 species of fish in the Casamance Estuary.
Crustaceans (shrimps and crabs) and mollusks dominated by oysters are present. Other species such as
turtles ( *Pelusios* *castaneus* and *Chaelonia* *mydas* ), mammals including the manatee
(Trichechussenegalensis), and dolphins ( *Tursiops truncatus*, *Souza Teuszii* ) are also reported in the

The sites to be reforested are degraded mangrove areas that are practically bare. These sites are classified
as suitable areas for the development of certain mangrove species, according to the site selection study [163]
and the evidence based on the presence of mangroves in the surroundings.

The process of identifying sites comprises several stages, looking to achieve a successful reforestation.
The success of reforestation will depend on the ecological conditions, the selection of species, and the
plantation design. Seedlings or propagules should be planted in submerged areas at each high tide,
including low tides in the dry season (Figures 34, 35, 36).

*Figure 34: Restoration sites in Sine-Saloum Delta. Photograph by Oceanium (2021)*

163 The stages of the process of identifying places for reforestation have been described in the document
Méthodologie de sélection de sites du projet MANCO" and include: 1) Identification of zones on satellite
image, 2) Recognition of zones with technical services and local authorities 3) Establishment of a buffer
zone, 4) Consideration of the management plan for Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) and the Biosphere

Studies of tropical habitat structure [164] have shown that the structural complexity maintains the greatest level
of biodiversity (Gratwicke & Speight, 2005 [165] ; Fuchs, 2013 [166] ). Mangrove forests provide a wide range of
niches maintained by sub-strata such as mangrove roots, which maintain a high level of biodiversity
(Gratwicke & Speight, 2005). According to the biodiversity survey, the biodiversity of the areas selected for
restoration is quite reduced. This is due to the low diversity of habitats in degraded lands or tannes.
However, in the surrounding areas, where mangroves are in good condition, the biodiversity is much richer,
including the six mangrove species described above, and the hundreds of species of fauna found in the
Saloum Delta biosphere reserve and in the Casamance Estuary. These mangroves offer many different
types of habitats that allow the feeding, nesting, and breeding of different species of birds, fish, mollusks,
mammals, reptiles, and other animals.

***D.*** **Threats to the biodiversity**

Different studies report losses in global mangrove cover of more than 50% in some parts of the world
(Romañach et al., 2018) *[167]* . FAO (2007) reported a significant decrease in mangroves in the world between
1980 and 2005, with an annual loss rate of 1% to 3%. Romañach et al. (2018) state that: “the global loss
of mangroves can be attributed largely to human population growth and development in the coastal zone.
Specific reasons are urban development, aquaculture, conversion to agriculture such as rice farming, and
overexploitation of timber throughout the world”. Besides, Alongi (2002) *[168]* also attributes the loss of
mangroves to “urban development, aquaculture, mining and overexploitation of wood, fish, crustaceans
and shellfish.” He also explains that: “in the coming years, unrestricted logging, aquaculture and
overexploitation of fisheries will be the biggest threats.”

In Senegal, specifically in Saloum Delta, human activities such as mangrove cutting for fish smoking, oyster
picking, and some fishing practices have led to mangrove degradation, reducing its area (Dieye et al.,

2010 *[169]* ; Sow & Ba, 2019 *[170]* ). Regarding Casamance, the degradation of mangroves is mainly attributed to
population growth, the significant withdrawal of its resources by communities, and the implementation of

been quantitatively assessed. This degradation of mangroves has led to a reduction in biodiversity (Solly
et al., 2018) *[172]* . Indeed, mangrove ecosystems are habitat, nesting, reproduction, and feeding areas for
many marine species (Ndour et al., 2011) *[173]* .

## CCB & VCS PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

*CCB Version 3, VCS Version 3*

Since the beginning of the century, some projects [174] have been successful in the recovery of mangroves [175] .
Some studies (Soumaré et al., 2020 [176] ; Fatoyinbo et al., 2018 [177] ) confirm a slight recovery of the mangrove
in some specific areas, at the local level, which could mean that the implementation of reforestation projects
does have a positive impact. However, although it seems that the global climate is becoming more wet, the
threat of unsustainable use of wood for firewood and other biodiversity resources is still very present.

According to Aghandoul (2017) [178], the French Development Agency (FDA), the Ministry of Environment
and Sustainable Development of Senegal (2020) [179], and Wetlands International [180], the main threats to the
mangroves in Casamance and Sine-Saloum are:

     - Climatic changes, which since the 1970s led to years of drought in the Sahel area, with a
decrease in rainfall and river flow, increased temperatures, and evaporation. This situation

174 The Mangrove Capital Africa program seeks to safeguard and restore African mangrove ecosystems for the benefit
of people and nature. They expect that by 2027, 1 million hectares of African mangroves are conserved or restored,
maintaining their biodiversity while also benefiting some 2 million people

favored the increase of saline waters and reduced the suitable space for the mangrove

swamp.

     - Implementation of hydro-agricultural improvements, which led to the felling of mangroves
and construction of roads, blocking water flows inland.

     - Impact of demographic movements resulting from droughts and political issues, among
others, causing the overexploitation of mangroves in new urban areas.

     - Unsustainable logging and use of firewood in mangroves.

     - Unsustainable fishing practices that overexploit fish and shellfish resources.

     - *C* onversion of mangrove areas into rice fields.

In the project area, these threats translate into concrete and direct risks for the success of the project.
These risks have already been identified in Section 2.1.18 Risk to the Project. Risks for biodiversity include:

     - If the selection of species and sites is not adequate, the climatic threat (drought, increased
salinity, etc.) will materialize in an increase of mortality rate of the trees.

     - If proper monitoring of the project is not carried out, the threat of unsustainable wood
harvesting may increase.

     - If fishing and use of resources is not carried out with adequate and sustainable methods,
the threat of overexploitation and decrease in the richness of fish biodiversity can become
a reality.

These species are dominated both in numbers and biomass, by Clupeidae (Sardinella maderensis, Ethmalosa fimbriata), Pristigasteridae (Ilisha africana), Gerreidae (Gerres nigri), and Carangidae species (Chloroscombrus chrysurus). In Sine-Saloum, Cichlidae and Mugilidae are the most consumed fish species by the local community. Crustaceans and mollusks are also well represented, with a dominance of shrimp (Penaeus notialis) and oysters (Crassostrea gasar). Being a wintering and feeding site, more than 200 species of birds have been inventoried. The reserve is home to 13% of Senegal’s waders and is also the world’s leading breeding and wintering site for the Royal Tern (hosting more than 1/3 of the world’s population). Also, an important population of medium and large fauna stay there partially: green monkeys (Cercopithecus aethiops sabaeus), warthogs (Phacochoerus aethiopicus), harnaché guibs (Tragelaphus scriptus), colobus bais (Procolobusbaduis temmincki)182, and sitatungas (Tragelaphus spekei), among others. It is a spawning and breeding site for a multitude of endangered species included in the IUCN red list, such as the manatee (Trichechus senegalensis) [VU], the Atlantic humpback dolphin (Sousa teuszii) [CR], and some sea turtles (Chelonia mydas, [EN], Lepidochelys kempii [EN], Lepidochelys olivacea [VU], Eretmochelys imbricata [CR], Dermochelys coriacea [VU], Caretta [VU]).|

**5.1.3** **Without-project Scenario: Biodiversity (B1.3)**

Without the project, according to the biodiversity survey and Section 3.1.4, the project zone would continue
to be degraded mangroves or tannes. These areas were degraded during the severe droughts of the 1970s
and 1980s and there has not been natural recovery. Approximately 2,400ha of mangrove was recorded lost
from 1970 to 1973 in Casamance (HARZA, 1984) [186] .

In the Lower Casamance, Marius (1985) [187] reported that since 1969, 70% to 80% of *Rhizophora* areas
have disappeared due to a decrease in rainfall, increases in salinity, acidification of the land, and excessive
logging. Even after a period of stability followed by a return of rainfall in the 1980s, the mangrove still
experienced a pronounced decline.

## CCB & VCS PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

*CCB Version 3, VCS Version 3*

Even after some mangrove restoration efforts (Cormier-Salem et al., 2015; Solly, 2018 [188] ), there are some
pockets of degradation. However, local people from the neighboring communities highly value the
reforestation projects undertaken by Oceanium (Chazée, 2019) [189] . According to this study, people point out
the importance of continuing mangrove reforestation projects.

In terms of biodiversity, as explained above (5.1.1 Existing Conditions), and as explained by various studies
(Gratwicke & Speight, 2005 [190] ; Fuchs, 2013 [191] ), greater structure and complexity in ecosystems leads to
greater biological diversity. The roots of the mangrove tree species provide food and shelter for fish and
the branches allow the feeding of birds and mammals, among other benefits (Gratwicke & Speight, 2005).
The structural differences of a mature mangrove (with *Rhizophora* in the first line, *Avicennia* further back,
and other species behind the *Avicennia spp.* ), allow a mosaic of different niches and habitats that generate
a greater biodiversity of invertebrates, birds, mammals, fish, reptiles, and amphibians. In degraded
mangroves, residents report a much lower diversity of fauna species (IRIN News, 2008) [192] . Therefore, in
the without-project scenario, which includes degraded mangroves or tannes, the biological diversity
remains poor, in contrast to the expected changes in biodiversity generated with the project, as explained
in the next figure.

|Justification of change|The presence of the mangrove helps to improve the parameters that define the quality of the water. The roots of the mangroves improve the transparency of the water, reducing the solid particles in suspension. Likewise, the presence of the mangrove stabilizes the pH, reduces salinity, and increases the dissolved oxygen (Jitthaisong, 2012)194. The water temperature is also lowered, and lastly, better water quality is associated with higher fish biodiversity (López-López et al., 2015)195.|

Due to the growth of new mangrove forests, food, oxygen, and
shelter for fish and mollusk species will increase, creating new
opportunities for recolonization, feeding for fattening, and refuge for
laying eggs and rearing.

|Parameter|Mollusks (abundance and structure)|

|Justification of change|Even relatively small-scale modifications to the structure of mangrove ecosystems can lead to significant effects on the diversity and abundance of mollusks in these habitats (Kabiret al., 2014)197. In general, the mangrove ecosystem is closely related to the presence of this type of fauna, while in current conditions (tannes or degraded mangroves) the presence of mollusks is very low or non- existent. In the project area, a large increase in oysters that adhere to the mangroves is expected, due to the large network of tree roots that will support them. This will be monitored as described in chapter 5.4.1 of the Monitoring Plan.|

population of fish, mollusks, crabs, and other invertebrates. Birds,
as the highest link in this food chain, benefit from more fish and
invertebrates, and their population is expected to increase as

mangrove cover increases.

In particular the wader population, birds that eat from bare ground,
and especially invertebrates from mud, is expected to stay as is or
increase due to the increase of mangrove habitat. To maintain some
areas without reforestation and because biodiversity will increase in
the plantation areas.
##### **5.2.2 Mitigation Measures (B2.3)**

As mentioned in the previous section, a positive impact is expected because of the return of vegetation
cover to the mangrove sites.

The growth of mangroves will provide more niches and habitat for the arrival of invertebrates, fish, birds,
amphibians, reptiles, and mammals. Besides the reforestation activity, small unrestored areas will be kept
(maintaining the initial bare area). This will favor a future mosaic of habitats, allowing waders to forage in
these areas. These areas are filled with invertebrates (crustaceans, mollusks, among others) at high tide,
which is used by these waders at low tide.

Regarding the HCVs designated in the project (the RBDS and MPA Niamone-Kalounaye Protected Areas),
and taking into account that 100% of the areas to be restored belong to the RBDS, and more than 50% of
the areas to be restored in Casamance belong to the Niamone-Kalounaye MPA, the activities to be
implemented in the project will influence these HCVs. Therefore, all project activities are focused on
achieving a mature mangrove in the next 30 years. As explained above, a better vegetation structure
enhances biodiversity. In conclusion, the measures and activities of the project will improve and enhance
the attributes of the project’s HCV.

The precautionary principle is also taken into account in the project through a total involvement of all
stakeholders in decision-making, thanks to the steering committee (see Section 2.3 Stakeholder
Engagement). Before being implemented, any activity or action will be debated by the communities and
stakeholders, scientifically tested by Oceanium professionals, and finally approved by the project
implementer (WeForest). An environmental assessment will be developed with the inclusion of the
precautionary principle in the project.

**5.2.3** **Net Positive Biodiversity Impacts (B2.2, GL1.4)**

As mentioned previously (see 5.2.1), positive changes in biodiversity are expected: increased mangrove
coverage, increased abundance, and improved structure of fish, mollusks, and birds, among others.
Specifically, the IUCN reports show how the quantity and diversity of fish increases, due to the submerged

root network, creating a unique and complex habitat, and improving the quality of the water. Fish are
attracted to mangrove forests because of the high availability of food, cooler water, and higher oxygen
content, as well as the shelter they provide (IUCN, 2017) [198] . Crustaceans, shellfish, and other mollusks
have a place to grow (the roots) and reproduce, benefiting from a better quality of water and food. In
addition, fish-eating birds are attracted by the increased availability of fish. Also, other animals such as
amphibians, insects, or mammals, are also attracted by the greater availability of food and shelter. Finally,
mangroves offer, through their flowering, opportunities for pollinating insects, such as bees.

In Section 5.1.1, the threats to biodiversity were discussed. Among them, it was written how human
pressures have been in the past and are in present time, according to numerous authors (Romañach et al.,
2018; Alongi, 2002), the most important threats to the persistence of the mangrove. That is why the project
will not only monitor the state of biodiversity, but will also monitor pressure and response indicators as well
(see Section 5.4.1).

The project, in addition to improving the biodiversity in the project area, also implies an improvement in net
biodiversity in surrounding areas and through indirect actions with communities involved. These activities
will promote the sustainable use of biodiversity. The communities will be strengthened in knowledge and
tools to improve their livelihoods and, among them, the local natural capital.

**5.2.4** **High Conservation Values Protected (B2.4)**

The HCVs identified are the protected areas of the Saloum Delta Biosphere Reserve and the MPA of
Niamone Kalounayes. Both protected areas seek to conserve and improve the area occupied by the
mangroves, its health, and its density. The reforestation project of degraded areas and tannes helps these
objectives and there are no anticipated negative impacts that would affect these areas.

The main activity of the project (restoration of degraded mangrove areas) is carried out according to the
agreement with the Ministry of the Environment and the Directorate of Protected Areas of Senegal, taking
into account the management plans of these areas, the projects in the planning phase and execution, and
the actors involved. The project’s environmental impact study [199] will properly describe the environmental
impacts on HCVs.

**5.2.5** **Species Used (B2.5)**

The project will use only native species for the main reforestation activity. Thus, the main species used will
be *Rhizophora mangle* (at an approximate density of 5,000 trees per ha) and *Avicennia germinans /*
*Avicennia africana* (at an approximate density of 1,000 trees per ha). Other species that will be used, when

ecological conditions allow, and looking for the existing mixture in natural conditions, are: *Rhizophora*
*racemosa, Rhizophora harisonnii, Laguncularia racemose,* and *Conocarpus erectus* .

The planting of *Rhizophora* species will be carried out through propagules obtained from areas close to the
places to be reforested. The people who will collect these propagules will be trained to select those of good
quality, and ensure they are not damaged during transport or planting work.

In addition, the reproduction of *Avicennia* species will be carried out through nurseries, using reproductive
material from the project region.

All these details are described in the document ‘Plantation design’ [200], available as supporting

documentation.

**5.2.6** **Invasive Species (B2.5)**

Considering the list of species used in Section 5.2.5 and the information in the ‘Global Invasive Species
Database’ [201], no invasive species will be introduced into the area affected by the project.

**5.2.7** **Impacts of Non-native Species (B2.6)**

As explained above, invasive plants will not be used for project activities. The plants to be used are endemic
plants and also come from areas near to the project area. Therefore, negative impacts from non-native
species are not expected.

**5.2.8** **GMO Exclusion (B2.7)**

Genetically Modified Organism (GMOs) will not be used in project activities.

**5.2.9** **Inputs Justification (B2.8)**

The project will not use fertilizers, pesticides, or biological control agents. However, at each verification, the
plantation will be monitored in order to evaluate its sanitary conditions and state of the mangrove.

**5.2.10 Waste Products (B2.9)**

Project activities will not, by themselves, create waste products to be handled in the project area. In this
way, the propagules to be planted will be transported in baskets, which will later be returned for future uses.
In the case of garbage from the people who will carry out the planting, care will be taken to check that no

product is thrown in the area to be planted and the people who will participate in the activity will be made

aware.

The environmental awareness will be included in different activities of the project, such as the following:

  - Training in HSSE (before every plantation activity).

  - Radio broadcasts, cinema debates, and other tasks included in the communication plan.

Finally, the ongoing advisory work (see activity C.2 in Section 2.1.11 of this document) includes an
environmental component on caring for the environment in general. The awareness of the society for the
care of the environment will be progressive and continuous throughout the lifetime of the project.
##### **5.3 Off-site Biodiversity Impacts **

**5.3.1** **Negative Off-site Biodiversity Impacts (B3.1) and Mitigation Measures (B3.2)**

As described above (see Section 5.2), being an ARR project, no negative impacts are expected from the
project. In this sense, the restoration of mangrove areas would positively impact (see Section 5.2.1) and
would benefit the identified HCVs (see Section 5.2.4). In conclusion, no negative off-site biodiversity
impacts are expected to result from the project.

**5.3.2** **Net Off-site Biodiversity Benefits (B3.3)**

The benefits of the project, outside the project zone, compared to the without-project scenario, are expected
to occur. First, a large number of the plantation areas are within protected areas (100% of the plots in SineSaloum are within the RBDS, and more than 50% of the plots in Casamance are located in the MPA
Niamone Kalounaye). The mangrove plantation is aligned with the management objectives of the areas,
which seek the conservation of biological resources and habitat [202] . The management plan of these areas
has been taken into account during the restoration activities.

Second, the project will increase the mangrove area in Sine-Saloum and Casamance, which will increase
the positive functions (ecosystem services) that mangroves provide to communities and their biodiversity.

Third, the location of the project area contributes to the continuity of habitat and ecosystems. In this sense,
there is a continuity of the mangrove areas in Casamance from the coast to (at least) the town of Goudomp,
around 100km, as commented on by local scientific experts, the biodiversity survey, and the eligibility study
of the land, available as supporting documentation.

Fourth, the location of the restored plots will improve the connectivity of ecosystems as a whole, increasing
the mosaic of vegetation structure and key habitats for biodiversity; and connecting green infrastructure in
the territory.

*Figure 41: Restoration of project area increases the connectivity of mangroves and ecosystems*

Finally, the project proponent and implementer are in contact with researchers and skilled technicians within
scientific committees and others. However, further studies are still needed regarding the effects of climate
change on the plantations. For this reason, as an additional benefit, the project will contribute to obtaining
more knowledge about this matter for future improvement in the restoration and conservation of mangroves.

##### **5.4 Biodiversity Impact Monitoring **

**5.4.1** **Biodiversity Monitoring Plan (B4.1, B4.2, GL1.4, GL3.4)**

The Biodiversity Monitoring Plan takes into account: (i) that the main activity of the project is the
reforestation activity of degraded mangroves areas; and (ii) the net biodiversity impacts that have been
described (see Section 5.2.3). The plan will monitor these impacts considering cost-efficient indicators
which are easy to use and learn by local people, without high technical needs.

Among the indicators chosen, there are indicators of status (such as vegetation cover or the quantity and
diversity of some species of fauna), pressure (such as monitoring of interference concerning illegal logging,
poaching, and land encroachment), and response (increased awareness of local people and re-planted
trees). The following table shows in detail the type of indicator, its description, name, units, monitoring
method, and monitoring frequency.

Some considerations for the implementation of the Monitoring Plan are listed below:

  - All monitoring activities will be carried out within the project zone.

  - The sampling procedures will follow the appropriate tools and methodologies described in the

Climate section.

  - Flora and fauna species are sensitive to changes in water quality. Changes in water quality (one of
the indicators of our Monitoring Plan) can impact flora and fauna. Water quality monitoring will be
carried out more frequently (every three months). Therefore, any changes in this indicator should
be analyzed with the perspective of taking the necessary actions to avoid negative impacts for the
expected biodiversity changes (Section 5.2.1).

  - The focal species of fish to be monitored have been selected for their endemicity and their situation
of vulnerability on the IUCN red list. The list of fish species to monitor before each verification is
presented below. However, other fish species may be added or removed from this list if the project’s
biodiversity experts suggest it, in order to improve the Monitoring Plan, and after approval of the
project management bodies.

*Table 57: List of focal fish species to be monitored (2021)*





As well as for the rest of the project activities, monitoring will be carried out with the participation of
stakeholders and local residents. The Monitoring Plan will be communicated to the communities at the
appropriate time, after discussion among the project partners, through the instruments identified in the
communication plan (radio podcast, cinema debate, and through the support provided along with the
project).

**5.4.2** **Biodiversity Monitoring Plan Dissemination (B4.3)**

The different stakeholders involved will participate in the monitoring. The following stakeholders will
participate in data collection and analysis: 1) The Directorate of Marine Protected Areas of the Ministry of
Environment and Sustainable Development; 2) communities involved in the project (coordinating with
mayors); 3) organizations with interests in the project.

The monitoring results will be published on the VCS and CCB websites, which can be easily downloaded
by stakeholders. In addition, they will be conveniently communicated to each of the stakeholders directly
involved or with interests in the project. The communication channels will be adjusted to each type of
stakeholder and to the available means according to the communication plan. This will include:

  - Executing and collaborating entities: communicating the results via email and during official project
coordination meetings.

  - Institutions and decision makers: communicating the results by email and through the steering
committee sessions, while collecting the points of view of each of the stakeholders represented in

them.

  - Civil society: through the cinema debates and radio podcasts. Likewise, the presence in the field
of Oceanium, close to each of the villages where the project is carried out, will allow them to work
closely with local actors regarding the data obtained in the monitoring and proposals for the next
data collection, in the interest of maintaining a good impression and transparency with local

residents.

  - Sectorial institutions (fishermen, merchants, farmers, etc.): the results will be communicated
through email, while they will be allowed to reply through this means or others proposed by them.

  - Academia: during the coordination for the execution of the research activities of the project
(Strategic line "D.Research, innovation and development"), fluid communication will be maintained
by phone, email, and other channels with the heads of the main academic institutions. The results
of the monitoring will be communicated and can be applied in the successive investigations to be

carried out.
