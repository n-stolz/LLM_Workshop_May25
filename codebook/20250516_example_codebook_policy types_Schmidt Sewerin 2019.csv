Policy type;Description
Education and outreach;Policies designed to increase knowledge, awareness, and training among relevant stakeholders or users, including information campaigns, training programs, labelling schemes.
Financial;Policies to encourage or stimulate certain activities or behaviours. These include tax incentives, such as tax exemptions, reductions or credits on the purchase or installation of certain goods and services.
Incentives and subsidies;Policies to stimulate certain activities, behaviours or investments. These include feed-in tariffs for renewable energy, rebates for the purchase of energy-efficient appliances, grants, and preferential loans and third-party financing.
Framework policy;Refers to the processes undertaken to develop and implement policies. This generally covers strategic planning documents and strategies that guide policy development. It can also include the creation of specific bodies to further policy aims, making strategic modifications, or developing specific programs.
Public investment;Policies guiding investment by public bodies. These include government procurement programs (e.g. requirement to purchase energy efficient equipment and vehicles) and infrastructure investment (e.g. urban planning).
RD&D;Policies and measures for the government to invest directly in or facilitate investment in technology research, development, demonstration and deployment activities.
Regulatory instruments;"Covers a wide range of instruments by which a government will oblige actors to undertake specific measures and/or report on specific information. Examples include energy performance standards for appliances, equipment, and buildings, obligations on companies to reduce energy consumption, produce or
purchase a certain amount of renewable energy, mandatory energy audits of industrial facilities, requirements to report on GHG emissions or energy use."
Tradable permits;"Refers to three kinds of systems – GHG emissions trading schemes, white certificate systems stemming from energy efficiency or energy savings obligations, and green certificate systems based on obligations to produce or purchase renewable energy-sourced power (generally electricity). In GHG trading schemes, industries must hold permits to cover their GHG emissions; if they emit more than the amount of permits they hold, they must purchase permits to make up the shortfall. If they emit less, they may sell these. White certificate schemes create certificates for a certain quantity of energy saved, for example one MWh,regulated entities must submit enough certificates to show they have met energy saving obligations. Again, if they are short, this must be made-up through measures that reduce energy use, or through purchase of certificates. Green certificates refer to renewable energy certificates that represent the certified generation of one unit of renewable energy, generally one megawatt-hour. Certificates can be traded among consumers and/or producers and used to meet renewable energy obligations."
Voluntary agreements;"Refers to measures that are undertaken voluntarily by government agencies or industry bodies, based on a formalized agreement. There are incentives and benefits to undertaking the action, but generally few legal penalties in case of non-compliance. The scope of the action tends to be agreed upon in concert with the relevant actors. These are often agreed to between a government and an industry body, with the latter agreeing to certain measures; for example, reporting information on energy use to the government, being subject to audits, and undertaking measures to reduce energy use.
